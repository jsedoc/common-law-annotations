            The annotation task is to label responses to a given prompt. The
            prompt consists of two people (A and B) talking to each other. The
            response is the next utterance after the final utterance in the
            prompt. The three base annotation criteria are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Appropriateness</strong>: The degree to which the output
              is appropriate in the given context/situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information content of outputs</strong>: The amount of
              information conveyed by an output.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human-likeness</strong>: The degree to which an output
              could have been produced by a human.
            </li>
          </ol>
          Each criteria is annotated on a 5-point scale where
          <strong>1</strong> is worst and <strong>5</strong> is best.

                Do <b>not</b> consider the humanlikeness of the response when
                judging its appropriateness. If the response fits the context,
                but sounds weird, mark it as highly appropriate.

                Do <b>not</b> consider the appropriateness of the response when
                judging its humanlikeness. Humanlikeness should depend only on
                the response itself, ignoring the context.

                  The response matches or references the context, but is highly
                  unexpected. For example, it might contradict a previous
                  statement, repeat word-for-word something already said, or
                  respond to an earlier part of the conversation.

                  The response could follow a large category of statements, but

                  The response has some well-formed parts that you can
                  interpret, but it’s completely unbelievable that the response
                  came from a human. For example, “It’s just north of here

                  in the conversation; however, the interpretation is a stretch
                  or strange given the context.
                </td>
                <td>
                  The response talks about something generic in a vague way, for

                  The response is well-formed, but doesn’t seem realistic,
                  sounds like a poorly written fictional person, or
                  over-explains. For example, “I am sleepy because it’s night
                  time, so now I will nap in my bed.”

                  The first interpretation of the response makes sense in the
                  conversation; however, it’s a bit strange, awkward, or
                  unexpected.
                </td>
                <td>
                  The response talks about something specific to the
                  conversation in a vague way, for example: “Park street is
                  great.”
                </td>
                <td>
                  The response is mostly believable as coming from a person, but
                  seems a bit strange. For example, the response is unreasonably
                  polite.

                <td>
                  The response is highly specific to the conversation. It
                  discusses something from the conversation in a specific way,
                  for example “I really miss them, now that they’re gone.”

                          The response is garbled text or nonsensical. It has no
                          reasonable interpretation. For example, “He green a”.

                          The response matches or references the context, but is highly
                          unexpected. For example, it might contradict a previous
                          statement, repeat word-for-word something already said, or
                          respond to an earlier part of the conversation.

                        <td>
                          The response could follow a large category of statements, but
                          not any statement, for example, “Why not?” or “I’m down for
                          that.”

                        <td>
                          The response has some well-formed parts that you can
                          interpret, but it’s completely unbelievable that the response
                          came from a human. For example, “It’s just north of here
                          UUUU.”

                          The response has at least one interpretation that makes sense
                          in the conversation; however, the interpretation is a stretch
                          or strange given the context.

                        <td>
                          The response talks about something generic in a vague way, for
                          example: “Yeah, I love that.” or “It really is great.”
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          The response is well-formed, but doesn’t seem realistic,
                          sounds like a poorly written fictional person, or
                          over-explains. For example, “I am sleepy because it’s night
                          time, so now I will nap in my bed.”

                          The first interpretation of the response makes sense in the
                          conversation; however, it’s a bit strange, awkward, or
                          unexpected.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          The response talks about something specific to the
                          conversation in a vague way, for example: “Park street is
                          great.”
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          The response is mostly believable as coming from a person, but
                          seems a bit strange. For example, the response is unreasonably
                          polite.

                        <td>The response perfectly fits the conversation.</td>
                        <td>
                          The response is highly specific to the conversation. It
                          discusses something from the conversation in a specific way,
                          for example “I really miss them, now that they’re gone.”
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          The response is perfectly believable as coming from a human.
                          You would not be surprised at all if a person had actually
                          said it.
