            The annotation task is to label responses to a given prompt. The
            prompt consists of two people (A and B) talking to each other. The
            response is the next utterance after the final utterance in the
            prompt. The three base annotation criteria are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Appropriateness</strong>: The degree to which the output
              is appropriate in the given context/situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information content of outputs</strong>: The amount of
              information conveyed by an output.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human-likeness</strong>: The degree to which an output
              could have been produced by a human.
            </li>
          </ol>
          Each criteria is annotated on a 5-point scale where
          <strong>1</strong> is worst and <strong>5</strong> is best.
