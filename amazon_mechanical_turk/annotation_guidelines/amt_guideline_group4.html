            The annotation task is to label responses to a given prompt. The
            prompt consists of two people (A and B) talking to each other. The
            response is the next utterance after the final utterance in the
            prompt. The three base annotation criteria are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Appropriateness</strong>: The degree to which the output
              is appropriate in the given context/situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information content of outputs</strong>: The amount of
              information conveyed by an output.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human-likeness</strong>: The degree to which an output
              could have been produced by a human.
            </li>
          </ol>
          Each criteria is annotated on a 5-point scale where
          <strong>1</strong> is worst and <strong>5</strong> is best.

            <b>Appropriateness:</b><br />
            <ol>
              <li>“this had nothing to do with the conversation whatsoever”</li>
              <li>“huh, wait, that’s very weird”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Response has at least a mild relevance to the topic discussed
                  in prompt but otherwise is a very unusual sentence
                </li>
              </ul>

              <li>“that’s absurd but lets move on”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An unusual sentence given topic-prompt or sentence
                  construction but people would just ignore it if someone said
                  that - because its not THAT weird
                </li>
              </ul>

              <li>“Hm. I guess that makes sense”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Follows logically from the prompt; typical response given the
                  context in the prompt. Sort of what was expected.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <li>“That helped the conversation”</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This adds new and relevant information to the conversation.
                  This is going above and beyond in the right direction for this
                  conversation.
                </li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Hard to infer anything about the conversation. Very generic.
              </li>

                <li>Example: “okay”.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Example: “Yeah I’ve been there”</li>
                <li>
                  You know they are talking about a place which counts as 1
                  thing
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>I know 2 things. Longer sentence.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example: “Yeah I’ve been there. I thought it was quite nice
                  actually”
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Multiple sentences with with 3 or more things.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example:“Yeah I’ve been there. I thought it was quite nice. My
                  mom liked it too.”
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                A long informative sentence (~>10 words) with LOTS to add in
                terms of specific.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Example: “The thing I like about the Taj Mahal is that it is
                  all one block or marble [...]”
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ol>

            <b>Human-likeness:</b><br />
            <ol>
              <li>Impossible for a human to say in any context</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Gibberish: “trhaiotjhoiath ^^ blah_cat”</li>

              <li>Correct words but very wrong</li>
              <ul>
                <li>grammar or word order “Go blue stuff very, I said?”</li>
              </ul>

              <li>
                some beginner ESL person could say this, i guess
                <ul>
                  <li>ESL: “Very nice that thing is”</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Someone would only say this in a weirdly specific situation
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>“It would have been nice if they had dunked it”</li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Technical language: “compile down your source code into binary
                  bits via the JVM”
                </li>
              </ul>

              <li>
                literally me or my circle would legitimately say this “Yeah i
                get you”
