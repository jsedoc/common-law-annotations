I am from the United States, but I have been living in the Philippines for the past few years.

Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. What kind of job is it for?
I would like to go to the beach, but I don't know how to get there.
I haven't yet, but I'm going to wear it to work tomorrow. I can't wait!
I just need someone to talk to. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone.
I'm not sure, but I'm glad we haven't. I don't think I could handle it.
What do you like to look at when you look outside?  The sky, the trees, the grass?

Speech is such an important skill to have. I'm glad I took it in high school.

Oh, that's good to hear. I hope he's doing better now. Do you know what the problem was?
I got a ticket for parking in a handicap spot when I wasn't handicapped.
I know what you mean. It reminds me of the smell of my grandparents house when I was a kid.
I only applied to one, but it was a reach for me. I didn't expect to get in.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been applying to a lot of places? What kind of job are you looking for?
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that? Is there anything I can do to help?
I've been here for a little over a year now.  I love it here.  It's a great place to raise a family.
No, I didn't hear anything about it. I just saw the wreckage on the side of the road.
I don't know, I guess I'm just not very good at it. I'm not very smart.

That sounds nice. What kind of sweater is it? Is it cold where you are right now?
I'm sorry to hear that. How did it turn out? Did you learn anything from it?
Oh no! I hope you don't get pulled over. I hate when people do that.

That would be nice, but I don't think they would ever do that.  It would cut into their profits.
You mean public transit? It's a form of transportation used by the public to get around.

I hope you have a great time! What are you going to do on your date with her?
Yeah, I think so too.  I think it will be a lot of fun.

Yes, it is.  It's nice to have a place to call your own.
I don't know what that means, but I'm sure it's a good thing.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Were you able to find your way out of there?
I know that now, but I was young and naive.  I learned my lesson though.
That's a good way to look at it. I'm going to do that from now on.

Due tomorrow, do tomorrow.  That's what I always say.  You can do it!
I don't know what to do with my life. I have no idea what I want to do.

That's exciting! Did you vote for who you wanted to win or for the lesser of two evils?

I know, right?  It's been a long time coming.  I'm glad it's finally here.
Obama was the first president of the United States of America to be born in Hawaii.

Why would I lie about something so trivial? I don't care if you believe me or not.

I was on my way to work.  I was going to pick up my kids from school.

I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I guess I'm just lazy.
I'd like to go to the beach, but I don't know if I can afford it.
I would love to, but I have to work late tonight.  What movie are you going to see?
I don't know. I just feel like I'm not good enough. I feel like everyone is better than me.
That's what I was thinking, but I don't want to be rude and ask to see it.
I meant to say 10 years old and 2 years old.  Sorry for the typo.
It was nice meeting you as well. I hope we can hang out again soon. Have a great day!
Oh no! Have you tried calling the bus company to see if they know where it is?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it? I'm here for you.
I like the fact that I get to meet new people and make new friends all the time.
That sounds like a good idea.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
I do, but I don't have a bathtub. I have a shower stall.
I know, but I don't know what I want to do with my life yet. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
That's a good reason.  Do you have a lot of stuff you need to get done?
I don't know. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. Thank you for listening.
That's what I've been doing, but I feel like I'm missing out on something better.
I'm not sure, but I know it's a lot of money. I don't know if it's worth it.
Do you like Warhol? He was an American painter, sculptor, and photographer.
Really? I thought it was 65 mph, which is the speed limit on most highways and interstates.
I'm waiting for my order to be delivered. It's been a few days now.
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking? I work in IT.
I'm sure she will. What kind of school is it? Is it a private or public school?
That's exciting! I hope you get approved. What kind of card are you looking for?

That's great! What kind of membership are you looking for? A gym membership? A personal trainer?
That's great! What kind of restaurant is it? Is it a chain or a local place?
I don't really have a favorite, I just watch whatever is on.  What about you?
Me too! I think he's the best president we've had in a long time. What do you like about him?
That's what I thought at first, but it's been there for a couple of days now.
Yes, it has been a long time. I hope you are well. How have you been?
I agree, people are very friendly.  I love meeting new people and getting to know them.
Oh my gosh, I would have been so mad! Did you tell him he was late?
We are staying at the Holiday Inn Express. It is a nice hotel.
Aww, that's so sweet of you to say. How long have you known each other?
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought it was always on the same day every year.
Yes it is!  I love it!  It's so much fun to be a kid again!
That sounds like a great idea! I love attics, they're so cozy and spacious.
I've never had that done before. What do they do with the blood? Do they test it for diseases?
Christmas is my favorite holiday. I love the lights, the music, the decorations.
It was, but it was worth every penny. It was the best steak I've ever had.
I thought I did too, but it turns out I didn't. I'm so disappointed in myself.
Do you know how to get rid of it? I don't want it in my house anymore.
Yes, I do. I am fluent in English and Spanish. Do you speak more than one language?
I know, right? I've been waiting for it to come out for a long time now.
Oh no! Did you find it or did you have to go back to the store to get it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you feel better soon.  What's wrong?
I'm sorry to hear that. How long has it been since you've seen each other?
That's great! What kind of membership are you looking for? A gym membership? A personal trainer?
It was a chicken noodle soup. I was so mad at myself for eating it.
I know, but I think I can do it. I just need to find the right person.
Sure, I can write you a letter of recommendation. What kind of job are you looking for?
That's great! I love the cooler weather. What do you like to do in your spare time?
What kind of party is it? Is it going to be a big one or a small one?
No, I didn't want to spend too much money. I just wanted to have a good time.
I know, I am so happy for her.  I just wish I could be there with her.
Do you have to show an ID to buy alcohol or cigarettes? I don't think so.
What kind of chips are we talking about here? I love me some salt and vinegar.
I don't think so, but I'm not sure. I haven't talked to him in a while.
Take the one that goes to the place you want to go.  It's not rocket science.
How old are you? He's only a few years older than me, but I still feel old.
Oh no! What happened to your car? Did you have to get it towed to a mechanic?
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I think I'm going to cancel.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you contacted your bank to see what's going on?
I do, but I don't know what else to do. I've tried talking to her about it, but she doesn't seem to care.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope everything goes well for you and your family.
I have a savings account, a checking account, and a brokerage account. I also have a credit card.
I hope so. I have been looking forward to this sale for a long time. I hope it is as good as they say.
I know, I hate it so much. It makes me want to drive my car off a cliff.
Yes they are, but it's worth it in the long run if you want to keep your hair healthy.
That's great! What kind of membership are you looking for? A gym membership? A personal trainer?
That's what I thought too, but I couldn't figure out what kind of sound it was.
I am going to the beach. I love camping. What kind of camping are you going to?
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I feel like I should be doing something else.
That's really nice of them. What did you do with all the gifts they gave you?
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure. Thank you for your help!
It is a beautiful place to visit, but I don't think I would like to live here.
Do you ever feel like you need to do it more often than that? I know I do.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. What did you end up doing to pass the time?
Pizza is always a good choice.  What kind do you like?  I like pepperoni.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if it was just me being paranoid.
I hope so. I have been studying a lot, but I still feel like I am not ready.
I'm sorry to hear that.  What kind of fees are you getting hit with?
Yes, they do. They have to go to school for a long time to be able to practice medicine.
What do you want to get started on? I have a lot of free time on my hands.
I teach 8th grade math.  It's a lot of fun, but I'm ready for it to be over.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not.
I know you will, but it's so hard to get motivated to do things like that.
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
That's true, but I don't really care about that. I just want her to be happy.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can get a ride from a friend or family member.
Oh, I see. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to make it work.
It was a gift from a friend. I don't know if I should wear it or not.
No, it doesn't.  I was just curious.  Did you have a good time?
Memorizing is the easy part. The hard part is learning how to apply what you memorize.

Yeah, he's fine. He's just a little fussy right now. I think he's teething.
I love USC, it's my favorite college in Southern California. Do you go there?
I did not know that! I will have to try that next time I make it. Do you like it that way?
That's what I was thinking, but I'm not sure what else it could be. It's not mold or anything.
That sounds like a lot of work. I'll just wait for it to heal on its own.
That would be nice, but I don't know if he would accept it. He's a pretty stingy guy.
I've never used it, but I've heard good things. What do you like about it?
I'm not sure, but it's been open for a long time. I think they just don't care.
Oh no! I hope you were able to salvage the situation. What did you have for dinner?
I know what it means, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get out of it.
I hope it works out for you.  I know it's hard, but it's worth it in the end.
Yeah, I was surprised too.  I thought it was going to be a lot more expensive.
That's what she said.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I agree with you though.
I think so too, but I don't want to feel like I owe it to her.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to make it work for you.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to go to the store to get new ones?
No, I live in a rural area so I have to drive to the city to catch the bus.
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What color do you want to paint it?
I don't like it either. It makes me feel nauseous and gives me headaches.
No, I've had it for a long time. It's just been sitting in my closet.
You are very welcome.  I hope you have a great day.  Do you have any plans?
Congratulations!  What kind of car did you get?  Did you get a good deal?
That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know if I'll be able to make it through the whole thing.
Yes, she did.  I am so happy for them.  They have been together for a long time.
I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong so I don't do it again.
Yes, it is.  I don't know what I want to do with my life yet.
I don't know, what would you like to get me? I'm not picky.
That's nice of her. What kind of soup was it? Was it homemade?
Yes, I did.  I was very happy about that.  Do you play golf?
I think so. We have a lot of talent on this team. We just need to execute.
I won it in a raffle at work.  I was so excited to get it.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get to spend more time with your family soon.
That's what I thought at first, but they were so crunchy and tasted like french fries.
I do feel good, but I feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
Me too! It's so much nicer than where I was living before. I can't wait to move in!

I'm not sure, but I'm glad they did. He's a sweetheart.
I can date whenever I want, but I don't want to date anyone right now. I just want to focus on myself.
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. What kind of PE class is it?
I did, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her. I was too busy watching the movie.
Yes, they do.  I was really impressed with how thorough they were.  It was a lot of work, but it was worth it.
I love to read.  What kind of books do you like to read?  Do you have a favorite author?

I know it's not, but it still makes me feel like I'm failing as a parent.
No, I don't have to, but I want to.  I feel like I owe it to her.
I don't think that's true. I think it has more to do with the fact that women are more emotional and men are more logical.
That's great! I'm happy for her. What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?
I didn't know that. I thought they were just there to cheer on the other team.
Wow, that must be a long bus ride. How long does it take you to get there?
I don't know. I just don't feel good about it. I feel like I'm not good enough.
I have no idea. I was so grossed out when I saw it. I don't even know how it got there.
Oh, I didn't know it was based on a book. I'll have to check it out!
That would be great, thank you so much! I'll be sure to pay it forward when I can.
That would be great, thank you so much! I really appreciate it. I'm so excited!

Yes, they can be very dangerous.  They can attack at any time, for no apparent reason.
What do you want to get started on? I have a lot of free time on my hands.

Hi john, my name is john as well. Do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
That's what I was thinking, but I just wanted to make sure. Thanks for the help!

That sounds like a lot of work. What do you plan to do with the tree after you cut it down?
You are very welcome.  I hope you have a great day.  Do you have any plans?
What did you warn her about? I'm sorry to hear that. Did she listen to you?
That's what I was thinking, but I don't want to get in trouble for it.

It happens to the best of us.  Did you make it in time for your appointment?
I bet that was nice to hear. What was the speech about, if you don't mind me asking?
I wish there was, but I don't think there is. I'm just going to have to tough it out.
No I do not.  I was going the speed limit.  What did you pull me over for?
That's what I'm leaning towards, but I don't want to hurt her feelings.
I know, I was so embarrassed. I didn't know what to do so I just went with it.

I know that, but I'm terrified of them. I can't even look at them.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any plans to cheer yourself up?

I know, it was hard to get a good picture of it, but it was pretty cool.
That would be great! I'm looking for someone to take over my lease. Are you interested?

What kind of purse is it? Is it a handbag or a satchel?
It really is. I am so thankful for her. She has been there for me through so much.
