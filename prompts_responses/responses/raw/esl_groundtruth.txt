Our copy machines include colored copies.
So I don't have to.
When were you at my house?
I can wipe it off for you.
Yes, there are checking and savings accounts.
Why don't you do something else?
You've lived here so long, it just seems like you would've ridden the bus by now.
Look at the signs at the stop.
Ok. Just get Basmati instead.
The hills are brutal.

You'd better register early.
I need to see your driver's license.

Well just use your fork then.
I don't accept late work.
Way to go!
You wrote a check you don't have the money for
Crappy insurance the government forces companies to offer.
You are an awful driver.
Why don't you cook dinner you smartass.
I remember now, sure get in then.
Absolutely I cannot argue with that.
Why can't I park here there is not sign?
Of course, you are the most suitable candidate anyway.
I hope you never have to use it.
Then bring them out and let's go to trial.
I like basketball the most.
Thank you for your honesty.
I like my salads with lots of feta.
Why would someone want a committee to vote for them?
Late is late, I don't make the rules.

You should see the Zebra at the fair.
At least it wasn't a nail.

MISSING
No but the frosting touched me.
I'll get my shotgun.
Don't be silly. I'm sure you look great.
Oh, That is wonderful!
Yes, I could hear the people nextdoor talking all night!
I guess we start by picking up a newspaper and checking the help wanted ads.
I know right.
With a basic checking account, you pay a flat monthly fee of $20.
I haven't exactly figured that out yet.
It's right around the corner for the subway.
Let's start with an easy question. How did you hear about the job opening?
Do you know why I pulled you over?
That's why I subscribed to cable.
How about the pond out back?
Do you need a tow?
Now I feel bad for you.
I need to see your driver's license.
He said that it does.
I spilled my drink, I'm sorry.
No one would help me.
Oh really where?
I've read that one before.
I stopped eating mayo on my sandwiches and took an hour long walk every day.
Well not forever but certainly for as long as the eye can see.
How do you know the driver was drinking?
What are you going to do with them?
How long did it take you to find one?
I love Italian food, what time?
You would be better off finding a shuttle I have to work.
Well then why don't you feed it?
Have you tried taking breaks every 20 minutes or so?
You are an awful driver.
It doesn't matter, it's still going to cost you.
No that show sucks.
Excuse me? I'm only being realistic.
To die I guess.
Well that's what you really mean isn't it?
None of your business.
I'm not.
Ok. We have a budget plan that might work for you.
He did amazing, he won by five points.
And what did it say?
Good we need all the support we can get.

A couple of sandwiches.

And how is it that they dress?
Me too always on my chin.
I need some extra balls.
Me too!
Yes, that's for sure!
I really should, but I've been procrastinating.
I don't see him very much.
It's a possibility!
Okay. When are you available?

The first time I was, but now I am not.
That reminds me of something my mom used to make.
Wouldn't that be a dream come true!
I hate to see you go.
It's a hockey stick.
I wish I could, but I'm from out of town.
I love the dollar store.
That's silly! I'll be careful!
No, I just lost track of time.
Ok. How can I help?
I'll send someone right up to take care of that.
Ok. Let's hit the soup and salad place.
Hey, don't you be so judgmental. Not all Republicans are the same.
Don't worry. I was being careful.
I see it. I'll go ahead and cancel that table for 6 people at 6 p.m. this evening, under the name Carlos Jones.
I suppose not. Let's go.
I bet that's not really true.
Yep, it is so calm looking out across the water.
No thank you, I am dating someone already.
Ok. We have a budget plan that might work for you.
Let me explain a simple formula many home sellers use.
Yes, I have to mark that for our records.

I would love to live here.
I just don't see it.
I have a Chevrolet.
Oh my gosh I fell asleep!
Yes some guy at the bar hit me!
That's going to be expensive.
We can look it up on google maps.
What are you going to order?
I could use another pair though.
Is there any way you could possibly move back?
It's closer to an A-.
I know, my dogs were howling their heads off!
Oh my gosh, she didn't?  Really?
It doesn't look like you need stitches.
No, I think that there is ban on going out into the water right now.
I'll send someone right up to take care of that.
It is very safe.
Is there anything I can do to help you out at home?
