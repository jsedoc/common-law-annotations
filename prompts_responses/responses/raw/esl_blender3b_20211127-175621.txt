I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better for you. What was going on?
Why are you disappointed in me? I am not the one who cheated on my spouse.
I am from the united states. I have lived here my whole life. How about you?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried talking to her about it? I'm sure she cares about you.
I would love to, but I have to work late tonight. What movie are you going to see?

I agree, but it's hard to do that when you live in an urban area. 
Yes, I travel a lot for business and pleasure. Do you like to travel as well?

It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little when I think about it.
I don't really have a favorite band, but I like a lot of different types of music.
No, I live in a rural area so I have to drive to the city to catch the bus.

I love flowers, but I don't want to have to water them all the time.

That's very nice of you. I'm sure she will appreciate it. I know I would.
No, it's a restaurant that specializes in Italian cuisine.  
I know what you mean. It reminds me of the smell of my grandparents house when I was a kid.
I would have been too! I'm glad you didn't have to deal with that. Did everything turn out okay?
I thought it was going to be a lot worse than it was. I was pleasantly surprised.
Wow, that's a lot.  Do you have a lot of friends?  I only have a few close friends.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. What is wrong with you?
Wow, that's a lot of people. Do you live in a dorm or a house?
I wish I had blue eyes, too. I have hazel eyes, which are a mixture of green and brown.
I know!  I was so mad.  I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
I hope you have a good time on the bus! It's a great way to get around.
It can be, but it's worth it in the end. What did you go to school for?
That's a good idea. I'll have to do that next time. I was so mad.
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking? I'm just curious.
I'm sure it is.  I wish I could go back to college.  What are you studying?
Did you say anything to her or did you just stare at her for a few seconds and walk away?
That's what she said.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I'll see myself out.

I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to wait a long time for the next bus?
I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of music do you listen to that hurts your ears?

Oh really? What kind of sale is it? I might have to stop by and check it out.

Yes, I am going on a cruise.  I have never been on one before.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Why do you regret it?  Was it a bad experience?
Oh no! I hope they were able to find the culprit. Did you call the police?
I don't like the smell of it, but I do like the act of smoking it. 
No, it's more of a puzzle game. You have to solve puzzles to get to the end.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better for you. What's going on?
No, I didn't want to spend too much money. I just wanted to have a good time.

No, it's not.  It's the truth.  I've seen it with my own eyes.
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm too old for it.
That's what I thought, but I'm not sure if I should be happy about it or not.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
That would be great, thank you so much! I can't wait to see what you find!
That's exciting! What are you going to be studying at the new school? Are you nervous?
I have, but it's been a long time since I've seen it. Do you like it?
I'm sorry to hear that. What is it about your picture that makes you feel that way?
I don't think that's the reason. I think it's because women are more emotional and men are more logical.
Oh no! I hope you were able to salvage the meal. What did you have for dinner?
I know, right? I don't know what it is about it, but I just don't like it.

I know, but I think it would be cool to see them on the big screen in HD.
That would be nice, but I don't think they will ever do that.  It would cut into their profits.
Yes, it is.  I am looking forward to it.  Do you have any pets?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay. Do you know who was at fault?
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you make it to your destination on time?
Yeah, that's what I thought too.  It was so loud.  I couldn't figure out what it was.
I think so too, but I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford to move.
I know. I was going 65 in a 65, which is the posted speed limit.

I agree, but it's hard to find a good story when you don't know what to look for.
Congratulations!  That's a great feeling.  How long did it take you to do that?
That's a good idea. I should do that too. I don't know why I didn't think of that.
That's a good thing, it means you have better traction on the ice and snow.

That sounds like a lot of fun! Where in Italy are you going? I've never been.

Of course! I'm always happy to share my wisdom with others. What would you like to know?
Stereotypes exist for a reason. I'm not saying they're right, but they exist.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find something that makes you feel good about yourself.
I know, but it still makes me feel bad. I don't know what to do about it.

Did you ask her out or did she ask you out? I hope it went well for you.

I do, but I don't know what else to do. I've tried talking to her about it, but she doesn't seem to care.
That's great!  I'm happy for her.  What kind of job did she get?
A few years ago.  It was for the best.  We just weren't right for each other.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your boss about it? They might be able to help.
That's a good idea. I should do that too. I don't know why I didn't think of that.
I love it when it rains. I love the sound of the rain hitting the roof.
Pink is a great color.  It's one of my favorites too.  Do you have a favorite color?

I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it's not too much of a hassle.

That is so sweet of you.  I bet she will love it.  What is it?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you not understand?  Maybe I can help.
I don't know, I just don't want to go outside. I hate the sun and the heat.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't know if it was just me being paranoid.
I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'm sure it's a good idea.
That sounds like a lot of work. I'll just wait for it to heal on its own.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you find something to eat soon.  What are you looking for?

I didn't, but I did see a car speeding down the road. I was so scared.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling the bus company to see what's going on?
That's true, but it's also true that the drinking age is 21 in the United States.
I'm not sure, but I think it would be a good idea to do something about it.
Yes, it seems like there is always something going on around here.  I love it though.
That's a good point. I don't want to get in an accident and not be able to get out.

Well, I'm a college student, and I work part time at a grocery store. How about you?
Do you think it would be a good idea for me to go back to school and get a degree?
Wow, that's a long time.  What did you do for the last hour and a half?
I don't know where to start.  I've never made one before.  Do you have any suggestions?
That must have been a long flight. How long did it take you to get to your destination?
I didn't do very well on the final exam. I studied really hard for it too.

You must be so excited!  I hope you have a great time!  Where are you going?
I don't want to go outside because I'm afraid of what's out there. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it.
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I am not sure what you are talking about.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you make it to your destination on time?
Wow, that's a lot of people. Do you live in a dorm or a house?
That's a good idea. I'll have to do that next time. I was so mad.
That's a bummer. What are you going to do with the money? Save it?
Do you have any suggestions on how to make it more correct?  I'm open to suggestions.
I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm just saying I don't know why you would.
I love USC! It's my dream to go there one day. What are you studying?

Do you think it would be a good idea? I'm not sure if I should or not.

Yes, I did. It's just that I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a new phone.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find a new job soon. What did you get fired for?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What kind of bike is it?  Is it a road bike?
What kind of scarf is it? Is it a winter scarf or a summer scarf?
That sounds like a good idea.  What are you going to do with the extra $100?
That's a good point. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.

Yes, I travel a lot for business and pleasure. Do you like to travel as well?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope everything works out for you.  You deserve to be happy.
I don't have to prove anything to you. You're just a random person on the internet.
I'm not sure yet. I'm still in high school so I have a lot of time to figure it out.
It can be, but it's worth it in the end. What did you go to school for?

How many kids do you have and how old are they? Do you have any other pets?
That's what I've been trying to do, but I can't seem to get used to it.

I've done that before. It was a long bus ride and I had to pee really bad.
That's a good thing, it means you have better traction on the ice and snow. 
No, I didn't. I was too busy trying to figure out how to get out of there.

I love flowers, but I don't want to have to water them all the time. 
I bet it was. I love chocolate cake. It is my favorite dessert. Do you like chocolate cake?
I am so sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay. Is there anything you can do to help him?
I did, but it was so long ago that I don't remember what it was about. 
I have a lot of suitcases. I travel a lot for work. What do you do?
I'm not being mean, I'm just stating a fact. I don't like it either.
Yes, it was.  I was so happy to see him again.  He's a great guy.
Why are you disappointed in me? I am not the one who cheated on my spouse.
Yes, I did. It's just that I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a new phone.
I hate when that happens. What are you doing on your phone when you are trying to sleep?
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one.
What do you want to get started on? I have a lot of free time on my hands.
What kind of dress was it? Was it expensive because it was a high-end designer?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to resolve the situation.
I'm not sure, but I think I'm going to have to get rid of it soon.
I know what you mean. It can be a little intimidating at first, but you get used to it.
No, I don't want to buy it until I know for sure that I will need it.
That's what I've been doing, but I feel like I'm missing out on something. 
That must have been a long flight. How long did it take you to get to your destination?
I can date whenever I want.  I just don't want to date anyone right now. 
I wish I had blue eyes, too. I have hazel eyes, which are a mixture of green and brown.
I don't know either, but I think I'm going to go for it. I think it will be fun.
I teach 8th grade math.  It's a lot of fun.  What do you do?
That's good to hear. I hope he can get back to his old self. He's one of my favorite players.
That's because I'm the leader of the group. I'm always the first one in and last one out.
I didn't know that.  I thought they were just there to cheer on the team.
I don't know any of her ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends.
Biology is a great field to get into. It is one of the oldest of the sciences.
I love them too.  They are so good.  Do you like them boiled or roasted?
I'm not sure, but I'm glad we haven't. I don't think I could handle it.
I do not mind at all. Do you have any suggestions on how I should go about it?
I know you will, but it's so hard to get motivated to do things like that.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you able to find another job quickly?
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get a job at a coffee shop or something.
That's true, but I don't want to waste my time if I'm not going to enjoy it.
Yes, you need to make sure that your parking brake is set and that your car is in park.
I hope you have a good time on the bus! It's a great way to get around.
That's true, but I don't think it's a big deal. It's not like I have anything to hide.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you feel better soon.  What is wrong?
Yes, I travel a lot for business and pleasure. Do you like to travel as well?
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you think you will be able to make it happen?
Oh, well I guess I'll just have to keep practicing and get better at it then.
Yes, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration.
I don't know yet, but I'm sure it's going to be a lot of money.
That sounds like a lot of work.  Are you going to do it yourself or hire someone?
I have a savings account, a checking account, and a brokerage account. I also have a credit card.
That's what I thought, but it didn't sting my eyes at all. It just burned.
No, I don't want to drink. I just want to have a good time with my friends.
Yes, they do.  They have to go to school for a long time to become one.
We have been friends for a long time, and she invited me over to her house. 
I was cleaning my room. I was so proud of how organized and tidy it was.
I like it a lot.  It is very sturdy and well made.  I am very happy with it.
Sure, what would you like me to do for you? I'm always willing to help out a friend.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your boss about it? They might be able to help.
That's cool. I've never been to either, but I've always wanted to go to Disney World.
What do you do with your checking account?  Do you use it to transfer money between your accounts?
That is good to know.  I would hate to be trapped in an elevator.
I can understand that. Do you have any hobbies that you like to do on your own?
I don't know, but he did.  I was so mad at him for doing that.
That's a good point. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.
That's true, but they also have to deal with a lot more paperwork and bureaucracy.
What do you babysit? Children, pets, animals, or something else?
Oh no! I hope you were able to salvage the meal. What did you have for dinner?
I know! I hate doing laundry. I hate folding and putting away the clothes.
I just got back from a week long backpacking trip in the Rocky Mountains.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll find a way to make it work.
I don't think so, but I'm not sure. I'll have to check when I get home.
I would love to, but I don't have a car.  Do you have a bike?
It's about an hour away, but I don't have a car so it's hard to get there.
I don't know, I haven't seen it in a long time. I hope it still looks the same.
I am from the united states. I have lived here my whole life. How about you?
I've never been there, but it's on my bucket list. Have you ever been?
I don't think so. I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. Are you?
I don't know, but I do know that I am the greatest. I'm the greatest at everything I do.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go there. Have you been before?
Yes, they do.  I have to go back to the store to get my money back.
Yes, he does.  He's a good dog.  I don't know what to do.
I know it is, but I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford a lawyer.
Oh, I didn't see it.  I'm glad you did though.  It's always good to have a backup plan.
What do you like to do in your free time? I like to go to the park and listen to music.
I don't want to use a picture of myself. I want to be able to use one of my family members.
Do you think they will be able to make it to the finals? I'm rooting for them.
I'm sure they are. I don't know what I would do if I found them like that.
I know, right? He's been racing since he was a kid, and he's still going strong.
That's exciting! What are you going to be studying at the new school? Are you nervous?
Sure, what do you want to know?  I'm always happy to share my thoughts on things.
Wow, that's a long time.  What did you do for the last hour and a half?
That's cool. What kind of paintings did you do? I like to paint as well.
That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure you'll get a lot of people to donate.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to call an exterminator to get rid of them?
Oh, I see. I'm not sure about that, but I do know that there are a lot of buses.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope everything goes well for you and your family.
Do you have any suggestions on how to speed it up? I'm not sure what to do.
I can try, but I don't know if I'll be able to get a hold of you.
No, it's more of a puzzle game. You have to solve puzzles to get to the end.
Hi lisa, nice to meet you. Do you have any pets? I have a dog.
What kind of party is it? Is it going to be a big one or a small one?
No, it's more of a puzzle game. You have to solve puzzles to get to the end.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find something that makes you feel good about yourself.
I live in California, so I know what you mean. The fires are really bad right now.
I do, but it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. 
I don't know, I just don't want to go outside. I hate the sun and the heat.
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm too old for it.
What kind of hard drive do you need? I can get you a good deal on a new one.
I did. I was so excited to see it again. It's one of my favorite movies.
Oh no! Did you have to go to the ER to get it stitched up?
There is, but I don't know how to do it. I feel like I'm going to explode.
Do you know if it will be streamed online? I don't have cable and don't want to miss it.
That sounds like a lot of fun! Where in Italy are you going? I've never been.
You must be so excited!  I hope you have a great time!  Where are you going?
Stereotypes exist for a reason. I'm not saying they're right, but they exist.
I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been lied to my whole life.
That is a lot of people.  I hope they can find the right people for the job.
They just talk about their lives and how they feel. It's nice to have someone to talk to.
It is located in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I am so excited!
That's what I've been trying to do, but I can't seem to get used to it.
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you are okay.  Are you okay?
I bet you couldn't. I would have done the same thing if I was in your shoes.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. It's a sequel to a movie I loved as a kid.
That's great!  I hope he does.  Saving money is always a good thing.
Wow, that's a long drive. I hope you have plenty of snacks and entertainment.
I would love to go to Hawaii, but I don't think I can afford it.
They can be, but they can also be white, yellow, red, blue, or green.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you make it to your destination on time?
That's great! I'm sure you'll do great. What kind of work will you be doing?
I didn't make them do anything.  They just did it.  I was so mad.
What kind of sweater are you looking for? I like sweaters that are knitted.
I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can get a job at a coffee shop or something.
It's a game where you try to guess what the other person is going to say before they say it.
They scare me because I don't know what they're going to do to me or my family.
That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight.
I'm sorry to hear that.  What do you do for work?  I hope you get a break soon.
What do you mean by that? Do you mean that it is too similar to other countries' flags?
I hope it goes well for you.  What kind of card are you trying to apply for?
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that. I'll move it right away.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Why do you regret it?  Was it a bad experience?
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you find it.  Do you have a big family?
I know, but it still makes me feel like I'm not doing a good enough job. 
What do you mean? I'm just trying to get it to work. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking? I'm an accountant.
Congratulations!  That's a great feeling.  How long did it take you to do that?
Yes, it's a nice neighborhood.  It's not a bad area at all.  I just don't want to get robbed.
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
It is, but I think it will be worth it. I have been saving for a long time.
That's very nice of you. I'm sure she will appreciate it. I know I would.
I have a great relationship with my parents. They have always been there for me. How about you?
Not yet, but I can't wait to wear it.  I'm going to the beach!

I don't think it's worth the hassle. I'm just going to let it go.

That's awesome! What kind of breakfast is it? I hope it's something yummy!
Congratulations!  What kind of car did you get?  Did you get a good deal?
That's what she said.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I'll see myself out.
She has a sore throat, runny nose, and a fever. She also has a cough.
It was!  I had it for lunch and it was so filling.  I think I'll have it for dinner too.
I have never smoked a cigarette in my life, but I love the smell of them.
You're welcome. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you soon.
Baseball is my favorite sport, but I'm not a big fan of watching it on TV.
I know!  I was so mad.  I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
Baseball is so much fun to watch. It's the most popular sport in the world.
I do that all the time. I don't know why I do it, but I do.

I'm waiting for my order to be delivered. It's been a week and a half.
It really does. I feel like I've been waiting forever for him to come home. I miss him so much.
I went out with my best friend. It was a lot of fun and we had a great time.
I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Do you mean the same way I do?
I love cats! I have two of them. They are so cute when they meow. 
That's a good thing. It means they care about you and want to be there for you.
Me too. I think he's the best president we've had in a long time. I hope he gets reelected.

What kind of conditions does he have if you don't mind me asking? I hope he gets better.
No, I live in a rural area so I have to drive to the city to catch the bus.
That's a long shift. What do you do for a living? I work at a grocery store.
I thought it was going to be a lot worse than it was. I was pleasantly surprised.
I wish I could, but I have to get up in the morning to go to work. 
I hope you have a safe flight.  Where are you going?  I've never flown before.
Yes, I understand that. I just wish they would tell me that instead of pretending like everything is fine.
Do you have a heater in your apartment? If not, you should get one ASAP.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find a way to help him.
I don't know, but I hope he gets there soon. I need to get to work.
I use Instagram a lot. It's a great way to keep in touch with friends and family.
I don't think so. I'm not sure if it's safe to swim in or not.
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought it was always on the same day every year.
That's what I thought, but I'm not sure if I should be happy about it or not.
I have a Toyota Corolla.  It's a good car.  How about you?
I can teach you if you want.  I love teaching people new things.  Do you want to learn?
That sounds like a good idea. What kind of food would you like to try at that restaurant?
It depends on where you are going.  If you are headed to the airport, I would wait at the closest one.
You must be so excited!  I hope you have a great time!  Where are you going?
I know, right? I don't know what it is about it, but I just don't like it.

I need a copy of your birth certificate, social security card, and driver's license.

What do you mean "of course not"? I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little when I think about it.
Yes, but I don't know if I want to go there. It's a chain restaurant.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find a new place soon.
Yes they are, but it's worth it in the long run if you have curly hair.
I know! I was so excited to see all of that. I can't wait to go back.
Oh no! I hope you didn't have to pay any penalties for not mailing it.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How did you break it, if you don't mind me asking?
I did when I was a kid, but I don't think I was very good at it.
I need the ball and the hoop, but I don't have the money to buy them.
I don't think I've ever had a good pineapple. They're always too sour.
I don't think that's the reason. I think it's because women are more emotional and men are more logical.
Sunday is the first day of the week. Mothers day is the second Sunday in May.
I bet it was. I love chocolate cake. It is my favorite dessert. Do you like chocolate cake?

She didn't do it for anything. She just did it out of the blue. I don't know what to do.
I am, but I don't know if I can make it.  I have to work.
That's very nice of him.  Do you like Easter?  I love the chocolate eggs.
I don't know, but it's gross. I'm going to have to clean it up.
I hope so too, but I don't know if they will. I hope they do though.
That's what I thought at first, but it's been there for a couple of days now.
I'm not sure, but I'm glad they did. He's a sweetheart.

I know, but it still makes me feel bad. I don't know what to do about it.
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll find the right one someday.
My mom cheated on my dad and they got a divorce. It was a long time ago.

It was!  I had it for lunch and it was so filling.  I think I'll have it for dinner too.

I just don't like it. I don't know what it is about it, but it grosses me out.
What kind of purse is it? I love purses, they can hold so many things!
I only applied to one, but I got accepted to it.  I am so happy right now.

She's a nurse.  I'm so proud of her.  She's going to be a doctor one day.
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I guess I'm just lazy.
That would be nice, but I don't think they will ever do that.  It would cut into their profits.

That would be great, thank you so much! I can't wait to see what you find!

I don't know, I'm just really bad at being punctual. I'm working on it though.
I'm not sure, but I think it would be a good idea. I'm so scared.
That's a bummer. What are you going to do with the money? Save it?
What do you mean by stylish? Are you looking for something to wear to a formal event?
I'm sure you'll figure it out. I hope you have a good trip. Where are you going?
It's a game where you try to guess what the other person is going to say before they say it.
I just don't like being out in the sun. It makes me feel like I'm going to get a sunburn.

I hope it doesn't.  I love the rain.  It makes me feel at home.
I didn't leave anything in my car. I was parked in a parking lot and someone broke my window.
Congratulations!  That's a big deal.  Did you vote for the winner?
I don't like the smell of it, but I do like the act of smoking it. 
That's what I was thinking. It's a nice room, but it's not a nice bedroom.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better for you. What's going on?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it? I'm here for you.

I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to get another one in the future.
It took me about a week to make. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it.
That's what I thought too, but I'm not sure what else they could be. I've never seen anything like it before.
I'm not sure yet, but I'm sure it will be more than I can afford right now.
Oh no, that's not good. Have you seen a dermatologist about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll find the right one someday.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did she listen to you when you told her about the new boyfriend?
I would love to go to Hawaii, but I don't think I can afford it.

I agree, people are very friendly.  I love meeting new people and getting to know them.
Oh no! I hope they were able to find the culprit. Did you call the police?
I don't know where to start.  I've never made one before.  Do you have any suggestions?
I know, but I think I'm going to give it a try. I think it will be worth it.
Yes, it seems like there is always something going on around here.  I love it though.

I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you find something to eat soon.  What are you looking for?
What kind of test is it? Is it a standardized one or one that you have to prepare for?
Oh no! I hope it's not too bad. What did you do to it to make it stop working?
I'm not either, but I'm sure it involves a lot of hard work and dedication.
Chicken nuggets and french fries are always a good choice. What else do you like?
We are going to the beach.  I can't wait to see the ocean again.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't know if it was just me being paranoid.
I don't know, maybe I'm just not that good at it. I'm not very good at math either.
Yes, he is.  I don't know what I was thinking when I agreed to go out with him.
I don't remember, but it was a lot of money.  I had to save up for a long time.

What would you like to know?  I'm not sure what I can tell you that you don't already know.

That's great! I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of the membership.
No, I am not kidding you.  I am being serious.  What do you think?
No, it's a skateboard.  I've been surfing since I was a kid.
I know that, but I'm terrified of them. I can't even look at them.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. What is wrong with you?
That's so cool! What kind of cake was it? Did he make it from scratch?
I love USC! It's my dream to go there one day. What are you studying?
I took that in college. It was a lot of fun. I learned about cognitive and behavioral psychology.

I have a sore throat, runny nose, and a headache. I also have a fever.
I'm not either, but I'm sure it involves a lot of hard work and dedication.
I know. I was so embarrassed. I felt like I was going to vomit.
I've never been there, but it's on my bucket list. Have you ever been?
That's a good idea. I should do that too. I don't know why I didn't think of that.
Nice to meet you Willie. Do you have any siblings? I have two brothers.
That is so sweet of you.  I bet she will love it.  What is it?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you soon. Do you want to talk about it?
I'm not sure what you mean by that. Are you saying that you don't believe me?
That's what I thought at first, but it doesn't smell or look like blood at all.
I don't remember, but it was a lot of money.  I had to save up for a long time.
No, it's more of a puzzle game. You have to solve puzzles to get to the end.
Yes, I did.  I was very happy about that.  Do you play golf?
It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little when I think about it.
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I am not sure what you are talking about.
That's what she said.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I'll see myself out.
It depends on where you are going.  If you are headed to the airport, I would wait at the closest one.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Why do you regret it?  Was it a bad experience?
Yes, he does.  He's a good dog.  I don't know what to do.
That sounds like a great idea! I'm sure you'll get a lot of people to donate.
I do. I feel like I've accomplished a lot in my life and I'm proud of it.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any family or friends that can help you out?
I don't think so. I just don't want to waste money on something I won't like.
Yes, but I don't know if I want to go there. It's a chain restaurant.
Do you have any suggestions on how to speed it up? I'm not sure what to do.
I want to go to the beach, but I don't know when I'll be able to go.
I hope it doesn't.  I love the rain.  It makes me feel at home.
I wish I could, but I have to get up in the morning to go to work. 
That's great! What kind of shoes did you get? I'm always looking for new ones.
Christmas is my favorite holiday. I love the lights, the music, the decorations.
That's good.  I hope you get a good deal on it.  Is it in a good neighborhood?
I know what you mean. It can be a little intimidating at first, but you get used to it.
I know, I'm so excited!  I can't wait to see how it turns out!
Congratulations!  What kind of car did you get?  Did you get a good deal?
That's what I thought at first, but it's been there for a couple of days now.
That's exciting! What are you going to be studying at the new school? Are you nervous?
I understand that, but I don't think it's a good idea to require an ID to vote.
No, I didn't. I was too afraid of what might happen if I touched it.
No, I don't believe in God, but I do believe in the power of prayer.
I hang them from the ceiling. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.
No, I am not.  I am terrible at math.  It is one of my worst subjects.

Oh no! I hope you were able to salvage the meal. What did you have for dinner?
Today is the last day of the school year, so I have a few more hours until lunch.
Not really, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you doing this for me.
I guess I don't have to, but I feel like it would be a good idea. 
That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any ideas of where you would like to go?
That sounds good. What kind of sandwich are you going to make? I love sandwiches.
Yes, but I don't have a car, so I have to rely on public transportation.
Yes, it was very tasty.  I was surprised at how good it was.  
That's cool. I've never been to either, but I've always wanted to go to Disney World.
No, I don't. I just don't feel like I have anything to contribute to the group.
I don't think I look like that at all. I was just trying to get a good picture.
The bus number is printed on the side of the bus, or you can ask the driver.
Why would I lie about something so trivial? I don't care if you believe me or not.
I know it is, but I don't know what to do about it. I can't afford a lawyer.
I think they mean that it's a good thing that you have a good relationship with your parents.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling the customer service number on the back of your card?
Oh no! I hope she is okay. Did she have a helmet on? Did she get hurt?
That's great!  I hope he does.  Saving money is always a good thing.
That's true, but it's also true that the drinking age is 21 in the United States.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can get a ride from a friend or family member.
I teach 8th grade math.  It's a lot of fun.  What do you do?
I'm sorry to hear that.  Savings accounts are important.  Do you have an emergency fund?
I am so sorry to hear that.  I hope you find it soon.  Do you know where it is?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any hobbies that help you stay motivated?
Yes it is. I was very lucky that I was able to get out of the way in time.
I have a chihuahua. He's the cutest little thing. 
I know, right? I don't know what it is about it, but I just don't like it.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if it was a good idea or not.
I don't know where to start.  I've never made one before.  Do you have any suggestions?
What do you mean the sooner the better? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.
I bet it was. I love chocolate cake. It is my favorite dessert. Do you like chocolate cake?
Hi lisa, nice to meet you. Do you have any pets? I have a dog.
Yes, it is.  He was born in 1947.  I remember watching him when I was a kid.
No, I've had it for a long time.  It was my grandfather's.
A tap card is a credit or debit card that can be used to pay for public transit.
I'm sorry to hear that. What is it about your picture that makes you feel that way?
I have a great relationship with my parents. They have always been there for me. How about you?
No, I have the key. I just don't know how to get in the door. 
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
Yes, they do.  I have to go back to the store to get my money back.
That's what I thought, but I didn't want to get too close to find out for sure.
I don't know, I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm too old for it.
Not really, but I think I'm going to go with the one that's closer to home.
That's a good point. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.
Oh no! I hope they were able to find the culprit. Did you call the police?
I know, I know. I am so ashamed of myself. I will never do it again.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
Today is the last day of the school year, so I have a few more hours until lunch.
Do you think it would be a good idea? I've been thinking about it for a while.
What kind of puppy are you thinking of getting for your son? I love puppies!
