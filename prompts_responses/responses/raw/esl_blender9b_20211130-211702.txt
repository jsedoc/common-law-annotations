I hate when that happens. Did you end up getting it or did you have to go to the post office?
What do they look like to you? I'm not sure what else they could be. I've never seen anything like it before.
That's a good way to look at it. I'm going to try to keep that in mind.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it was at least productive. What did you do?
I know, I feel so ashamed of myself. I'm going to try to make it up to her.
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
I know what you mean.  I have a lot of homework too.  Do you like school?
I would love to, but I have to work late tonight.  What movie are you going to see?
No, I just don't like confrontation. I don't want to have to deal with it.
Why do you say that? Do you not like the outdoors? Or do you just not like bears?
Yes, I am a business traveller. I travel a lot for work and pleasure.
I bet you do.  I love to eat.  What is your favorite thing to eat?
No, I didn't. I was too busy trying to figure out what was wrong with my food.
It depends on where you work.  Some places give you an hour, some give you two fifteen minute breaks.
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. What are you studying for the test?
No, it was a black ball.  I hit it straight down the middle of the fairway.
What kind of information would you like to know? I can tell you anything you want to know.
That would have been a disaster.  I was so thankful that it didn't rain.

It's okay. It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little bit.
I don't really have a favorite band. I just listen to whatever is on the radio. What about you?
No, I'm taking the train. I've never been on a train before, so I'm a little nervous.
Why would I lie about something like that? It's not like I'm going to get anything out of it.
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
That is very nice of him.  How much does he give?  Is it a lot?
I know what you mean. It's hard to find the time to do it when you have so many other things to do.
It was a long time ago, but I still think about it from time to time.  
That sounds like a good idea.  What kind of park are you thinking about going to?

Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I will pay you back as soon as I can.
No, it's a sit-down restaurant. It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.

Oh wow, how did it go? Did you have to wait a long time for the bus?
What made you think it was going to be harder than it turned out to be, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that too. I don't want to have to call a locksmith.
That's a lot of checks.  What do you think you'll do with all of them?
I'm sure it is, but you have to do what's best for you in the long run.
Did you say anything to her? How did it make you feel to bump into her like that?
That's what I was thinking, but I don't know what to do with it now.

Yes, it does.  Did you have a good time?  What was your favorite part?
That's true, but you'll get used to it. Just try to make some friends and you'll be fine.
I am so sorry to hear that.  Have you reported it to the police?  Do you know who did it?
I didn't even know there was a movie. I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
That's what I thought at first, but they tasted like potatoes. I was so grossed out.
They talk about all kinds of things. It's nice to have someone to talk to that you can relate to.
Yeah, I was pretty upset about it. I don't know what I'm going to do now.

It was a gift from a friend. I don't know if I should wear it or not.

No, I've never seen it.  I don't even know what channel it's on.
Why don't you like your picture? Is it because you don't think you look good in it?

Me too, I was starting to think I was the only one with this problem. I hope they fix it soon.
That's what I'm thinking too. I think I'm going to go for it. Thanks!
I am sure you will be able to fit into it when you reach your goal weight. Good luck!
Do you have a debit card that you can use to withdraw money from an ATM?

I'm sorry to hear that. Did you get a chance to catch up on the sleep you missed?

That's all I could think of at the moment. I'm sure I'll think of more later.
Okay, I'm sitting down.  What do you want to talk about?  Do you have any hobbies?

Good morning to you as well!  How are you?  Did you have a good weekend?
I'm not sure, but I don't think so. I think they have to pay for it.
That's what I was afraid of. Do you know what kind of bug it is so I can avoid it in the future?
I don't know, but I hope he gets here soon. What time is it where you are?
I hate when that happens. Have you tried contacting the company to see what's going on?

I don't know. I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I love tigers! They are my favorite big cat. What is your essay about?
I used to smoke cigarettes but I quit a few years ago. They are so bad for you.
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
You're welcome. I hope he does a good job. I think he has a good chance.
I don't have to prove anything to you. I know what I know and you know what you know.
I would like to go to the beach. I haven't been there in a long time.
Oh no! Did you have to go to the store to get some? I hate when that happens.
Yes, there is a lot of things to do around here. It's a great place to live.
I know, right?  It's so hard to pick just one.  They're all so good.
I don't think so.  I think it was just a fluke.  It tasted fine.
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking? And why do your friends know?
I don't know. I just can't seem to grasp the concepts as well as I should.
Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I don't know much about that. I hope you find what you're looking for.
I'm sorry to hear that. Did she give you a reason why she didn't show up?
That sounds like a great idea.  Where would you like to go?  I've always wanted to go to Alaska.
I had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated and my blood pressure was so high.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. What's going on?
Oh no! Mosquitos are the worst. I hope they don't bother you too much.
Baseball is a great sport. I love it too. Do you have a favorite team?
Oh wow, what kind of cake was it?  Was it a special occasion or something?
That's awesome! What kind of breakfast do you get? Do you get to pick what you want?
About a year and a half ago. It was a very amicable divorce, though.
I'm the same way. I always say I'm going to do something and then never do it.
You must be so proud of your son. I'm sure he's a great athlete. 
I don't blame you.  I would have done the same thing.  What did you end up getting?
Do you know if it will be televised? I can't seem to find any info on it.
What do you mean by stylish? Do you want something that looks good or something that is functional?
That sounds like a good idea.  What kind of snacks do you like to take to work?
I know, I am so ashamed of myself. I don't know what I was thinking.
That's exciting!  What kind of furnature did you get?  Was it expensive?
Orange is my favorite color. I was so happy when I found out it wasn't orange.
I know, but I don't know what else to do. I'm not good at anything else.
I am waiting for a package from amazon. It is supposed to arrive today but it hasn't yet.
I am waiting for a package from amazon. It is supposed to arrive today but it hasn't yet.
They can be, but they can also be a great source of companionship and entertainment.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't know if there was something I was missing.
No, I just need your social security number and your mother's maiden name to verify your identity.
I know, I hate it when people don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.
I use command strips. They work really well and don't leave any marks on the wall.
I know, but I feel like I'm being punished for something I didn't even do.
What would you like to know? I can tell you anything you want to know about it. 
No, I am not kidding you.  I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
Why did you get out of your car?  Were you in a hurry to get somewhere?
I thought I did too, but I guess I didn't. I feel so ashamed.
Nice to meet you, Willie.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
What kind of lunch do you want to get? I love a good ham and cheese sandwich.
I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm living up to my full potential.
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I was starting to think I was going crazy.
I'm not sure what you mean. Do you have a table you want me to look at?
That's what she said.    I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. 
What did you love about it?  What was your favorite part?  Did you have a favorite character?
Hi lisa, my name is lucy, nice to meet you. Do you have any hobbies?
Yes, it looks exactly the same as it did when I was a kid. It's amazing.
I don't know. I think I would prefer to be alone, but at the same time I feel lonely.
I did. I had to call a locksmith to come and open it for me.
I want to be buried. I don't want my body to decompose in the ground.
That sounds like a good plan.  What are you going to do with the extra $100?
Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite veggies. Do you like them?
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.
Why do you think that?  Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
I've been studying for my finals. I'm so ready for them to be over.
My relationship with my parents is good.  They are both alive and well.  How about yours?
No, it's a skateboard. I'm not very good at it, but it's still fun.
Oh no! I hope you feel better soon! Drink lots of water and get some rest!
Yes, it was so hot and humid. I felt like I was going to pass out.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that can help you out?
Are they? I've never ridden in one, but I always imagined them to be uncomfortable.
How long does it take you to get to school? Do you have to walk or ride a bike?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did you get fired, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of commitment.
Oh really? What grade are you in? I'm in Algebra II right now.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if I was just being paranoid.
Yes you do. Science is the study of the physical and natural world through observation and experimentation.
Yes, I can write you a letter of recommendation.  What do you need it for?
Oh, well good luck with that.  I hope you get the job.  What kind of job is it?
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?  Do you enjoy it?
That's not how gravity works. Gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime.
I can understand that.  Do you have a dog?  They can be a great deterrent.
Yes, I did. I am glad to hear that you are doing well. Did you have a good weekend?
I need a copy of your birth certificate, social security card, and driver's license.
No, I mean the one with the actors, writers, producers, and directors.
I didn't do anything. I was so ashamed of myself. I don't know what I was thinking.
I have no idea. It's been like that for years. I think they just don't care.
He did, but I can't remember what it was. I think it was in the afternoon.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Maybe you can do something fun.
Yes, I did. I am glad to hear that you are doing well. Did you have a good weekend?
I am sorry to hear that.  I hope you find something soon.  What do you like to eat?
That's a good one. I'm glad I don't have to worry about getting sick from that anymore.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was something I was missing.
The Affordable Care Act is an American health care law enacted by Barack Obama in 2008.
I just don't like them. I don't know why, but I just do not like them at all.
I had my first kiss when I was 14. It was with my high school sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
That sounds like a lot of work.  What color do you want to paint the house now?
I don't know. He's always been a bit of a jerk, but I thought he was better than that.
I know, right? It's like I'm the only person in the world who likes the color green.
That sounds like fun!  What are you going to see?  Is it your first time there?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried contacting Muni to see if they know where it is?
No, I've had it for a few years now. It's just been sitting in my closet.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you live in a bad neighborhood or is it something else?
Yes it is.  I love spring.  It is my favorite season.  What is your favorite season?
I know, but I don't have a bathtub. I have to take showers.
Do you have a lot of things you need to take with you when you go on vacation? 
I don't know. I hope not. He's a good kid. I just don't want him to get in trouble.
There is, but I don't have a car, so I have to rely on public transportation.
I would love to go with you. What are we going to do while we are out there?
Why not? Who are you going to vote for, if you don't mind me asking? 
Oh no! Did he make it on time for the rest of the date or did you have to cancel?
What kind of pencil is it? Is it a mechanical pencil or a wooden one?
Oh no! I hope you were able to get some sleep eventually. What time did you go to bed?
I have a Honda Civic.  I love it.  What about you?
I went out with one of my best friends from high school. It was a lot of fun.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
I bought a new car.  I am so excited about it!  I can't wait to drive it!
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get out of it.
That's part of it. The other part is that I just don't feel like doing anything.
I love the Dollar Store!  It's so cheap!  What did you buy?
That's too bad.  Where do you live?  I'm in the U.S.
Oh really? I didn't know that. I'll keep that in mind next time I get a ticket.
I will send you a picture of the apartment when I get home from work. It is very nice.
There will be a sign that says "wait here for the next bus" or something like that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about what's going on in your life?
USC as in the University of South Carolina? That's awesome! What are you studying?
No, I'm agreeing with you. I was just adding on to what you were saying.
I teach 7th grade science.  It's a lot of work, but I love it.
I'm glad to hear that.  Did you do something nice for someone?  Or were you just being a good person?
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
My dad cheated on my mom. It was a long time ago, but it still hurts.
Yes, I agree.  I am so ready to move on with my life and start a new chapter.
Not yet, but I can't wait to try it on.  I've been looking forward to it all day.
That's cool. Did you go to the mall? I love going to malls.
Oh no! Did you have to sit next to someone you didn't want to be next to?
What do you do for a living?  I'm a programmer, so I type a lot too.
I'm sure I won't, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I've got nothing to lose.
Chocolate cake is my favorite!  I love chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like chocolate cake?
He said it could be a number of things, but it was most likely a viral infection.
I don't know what to tell you then.  I've never had that happen to me.
Of course I don't! I'll send you a message with the link. I hope you enjoy it!
Yeah, I was surprised too. I guess it makes sense though, since it's the same company.
Do you have any advice on how I should go about it? I don't want to come off as desperate.
I hope you find it soon.  I hate when I lose my buttons.  It's the worst.
Wow, congratulations! What kind of car did you get? I hope you enjoy it!
That's a good reason. Do you have a car or do you rely on public transportation?
I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot.  I was so mad at myself.
I'm not sure, but I hope so.  I don't want anyone to get sick.
I know, right?  I was laughing so hard.  It was so unexpected.
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you going to keep it or give it up for adoption?
That's what I'm leaning towards. I don't want to deal with the hassle.
I can imagine that can be stressful.  Do you have a lot of customers that treat you poorly?
Yeah, I was a little worried about that, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to pay too much for it.
Yes, they both have locks.  I don't know why he didn't use them.
That's great to hear. How long have you been married and how many kids do you have?
Me too! I can't wait to see what it's like to live in a new place.
I don't think so, but I'm not 100% sure. I think it's free.
You can have anything you want, but you have to eat it all in one sitting. What do you want?
I haven't seen my family in a long time either. I hope you get to see them soon.
Are you sure it's not just your imagination? I've heard that can be a symptom of schizophrenia.
Yes. Opera is a type of musical theatre that originated in Italy.
I don't know.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens. 
What time do you have to go to bed to be able to wake up at that time in the morning?
I bet she did.  Did you get a chance to meet her in person before the wedding?
Wow, that's a long time! What do you do for the company, if you don't mind me asking?
Oh, that's cool. What are you going to be studying in the Summer courses?
It's supposed to be sunny and in the 70s. I'm looking forward to it.
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
I think so too, but I don't want to come off as needy or clingy.
That's true, but I don't think I've ever seen a snake in my neighborhood.
I don't think I look like that, but I guess I can see why you would think that.
Oh, I see. Thank you for the clarification. Do you know when the vote will be held?
What kind of restaurant is it? Is it a fast food place or a sit-down restaurant?
I don't watch TV or listen to the radio, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I am sure you will figure it out.  What is the asking price you have in mind?
Do you know what they are practicing for?  I hope it's not for a game.
That's pretty much it.  It was a good day.  I got to spend time with my family.
No, I just don't want to go. I don't like being around a lot of people.
I know it is, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel so ashamed.
I'm sure she will! What kind of school is it, if you don't mind me asking?
What don't you understand? I'll try to explain it to you as best as I can.
You can find them in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
Have you ever applied for a credit card before? It's a great way to build your credit.
I'm sure they will! What kind of drawings do you do? I love to draw.
I know what you mean.  I love the way my husband smells when he gets home from work.
I'm sure I won't, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I've got nothing to lose.
Oh, I didn't know that. I'm not from the US, so I don't know much about it.
Yeah, I've been busy with school and work, but I'm getting back into the swing of things.
Yeah, sorry about that. I didn't realize how dark it was until after I took the picture.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you'll be able to pass the class? 
I love cats! What kind of dog do you have? I have a golden retriever.
No, I didn't. What happened to him? Did he make it to his destination safely?
I used to think the same thing about basketballs. I thought they were all white and black.
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
Do you like it?  I'm not a big fan of it, but my kids love it.
I did, but luckily I was able to hold it in until I got to my destination.
You have to go to the DMV and register to vote. You can do it online.
No, I don't know why you pulled me over. Can you tell me why you did?
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. It's going to be a lot of fun.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go there. What are you going to do there?
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was anything else I should do first.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to relieve the pain?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that could help you out?
Stress can cause stomach aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Oh, I didn't know that. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.
I didn't know that, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate so I don't think I'll try it.
I don't know. It just won't turn on. I've tried everything I can think of.
I am too. He is my favorite golfer. I hope he can bounce back.
I agree, but I don't have a lot of money, so I have to choose wisely.
No, they are over the counter.  You can get them at any pharmacy.
You'll have to trust me on that one.  I've been doing this for a long time.
I do too, but I don't want to be dependent on caffeine anymore.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you find a new one soon.
I've never been there, but I've heard it's beautiful. What do you like about it?
That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't want to look like an idiot.
I am waiting for a package from amazon. It is supposed to arrive today but it hasn't yet.
I don't know, I just don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment.
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't being too judgmental.
I don't know. I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
That's good to hear.  What's going on?  Did you have a bad day?
You can use a debit card, credit card, or a prepaid Visa card.
It does to me. I don't like being lied to, especially by someone I care about.
I know, but it was the first time I had seen it and I thought it was hilarious.
She has a lot of pain in her abdomen and back. She also has a fever.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it works out for you. What are you waiting for?
Where did she say they were from?  Did she say the name of the country or region?
What do you mean by safe area? Do you mean a place where there is little to no crime?
That sounds like a great idea! What kind of food do you like? I'm a big fan of Italian.
I listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite band is the Beatles. What about you?
That would be so nice of you.  I'm sure he would love that.  How old is his son?
Oh no!  How did that happen?  Did you have to go to the ER?
Yes, I scored in the 98th percentile on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
I'm sorry to hear that. Chemistry is tough. Did you have a good teacher?
Oh really? What did you see in my driveway? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes they are! I have to use the expensive stuff because my hair is so thick and curly.
I don't know. I just can't seem to get out of bed in the mornings.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if I was overthinking it.
It gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride in what I have accomplished in my life.
That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that. I guess I just don't like the way it looks.
I live in a rural area, so I have to drive to the city to do anything.
I think so too. I think it will be a lot of fun. I can't wait!
What kind of books do you like to read? Fiction, non-fiction, biographies?
Oh no! I hope it wasn't too bad. Did you go to the doctor to get it checked out?
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought it was just mine. That's good to know.
Oh, I see. Well, I hope you enjoy it when you get a chance to play it!
Yes. Opera is a type of musical theatre that originated in Italy.
They do, but they also have to go to school for a long time to get to that point.
Yes, it is a 24 hour diner.  It is the only one in the area that is open that late.
I know, I was so ashamed of myself. I will never make that mistake again.
I need you to go to the store and get me a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread.
Thunder is the sound produced by lightning. I love thunderstorms. 
Teaching is a great profession.  What grade level do you teach?  Do you enjoy it?
I'm not being sarcastic, I'm being honest.  I think it's a great idea.
Oh no, what happened to the other one? Did you lose it, or did someone steal it?
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you have to stay an hour longer than you planned?
I think so.  It's a nice neighborhood.  I just don't want to be a bother.
That's not too bad. Did you make it on time for everything else you had to do?
I hate when that happens. Did you have a lot of contacts on your old phone? 
I don't know, but I wish I knew who she was so I could get to know her better.
That seems like a lot to me, but I guess it depends on the size of the city.
Sure, I can send them to you when I get back to my dorm. What are you studying?
That's true, but I don't really care about that. It's the fact that she lied to me that bothers me.
I haven't tried it yet. I don't know if I want to. I'm afraid it will make me sick.
I know what you mean. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get used to it, it's not so bad.
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
That is a good thing.  How much money will he save?  Is it a lot?
I don't think I've ever had a fatty steak before. Do you like it?

It was! I was so happy with how it turned out. I can't wait to make it again.
I love bread. It's so versatile and can be used in so many different ways.
That must have been a long flight.  Did you have to get up to go to the bathroom?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What kind of bike is it?  Is it a road bike or a mountain bike?
That's a good idea.  I should do that too.  It's been a while.
I don't want to walk all the way to the bathroom just to find out that I'm out of tissues.
That's what I was thinking. I got a ticket for parking in a handicap spot and it was over $300.
Hi John, my name is also John.  How are you today?  Do you have any hobbies?
Me too! It's so nice to be able to relax and not have to worry about anything.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that could help you out?
Yes, it is.  I hate driving in it.  Do you have to drive in it a lot?
I'm not sure, but I'm looking forward to it. It's been a while since the last one.
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
Why do you hate flying?  I love it.  Flying is one of the safest ways to travel.
I know, I just don't like them crawling on me when I'm trying to sleep.
Due tomorrow? Do it today!  +/u/dogetipbot 100 doge verify
That's what I'm afraid of. I don't want to pay for something I didn't do.
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I have been waiting for this day for a long time.
That's really nice of them.  Did you have a good time at the reunion?
I haven't decided yet, but I think I'm going to go with the Democratic candidate.
That's great! I'm glad you were able to find a copy. I hope you enjoy it!
Yes, I always make sure to clean my nails and cuticles before I go to bed.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
I don't understand why they would want to do that. Pit bulls are great dogs.
Why would I lie about something like that? It's not like I'm going to get anything out of it.
I know it is, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  
I don't mind at all.  What do you have in mind?  I love surprises!
That's nice of you. What are you going to get him? Is it a special occasion?
No, I just need your social security number and your mother's maiden name to verify your identity.
Why do you say that? It's been raining here for the past couple of days. 
I can try, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get through to you.
Milk is a good source of calcium, vitamin D, and protein.
No, I've had it for a few years now. It's just been sitting in my closet.
That sounds like a lot of work. Why do you want to do that, if you don't mind me asking?
I know!  I was so mad.  I don't know what I'm going to do now.
Hi lisa, my name is lucy, nice to meet you. Do you have any hobbies?
That's what I was thinking. I got a ticket for parking in a handicap spot and it was over $300.
I haven't tried it yet. I don't know if I want to. I'm afraid it will make me sick.
Wow, that's a lot of money. What are you going to do with all that money?
I don't know about you, but I sure as hell didn't have one in my school.
I love it too, but I hate shoveling it out of my driveway. 
Oh, I see. Well, I hope you enjoy it when you get a chance to play it!
I do too. It's nice to be able to see the stars and the milky way.
I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm living up to my full potential.
I washed a pair of jeans that I had worn for the first time in a while.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to make it work for you.
Really? That would be great! I've always wanted to learn how to play the violin.
I am sure you will do great.  Just be yourself and be confident.  You got this!
Potatoes are a great source of carbohydrates and vitamins and minerals.
Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be a lot worse.
I'm going to the beach! I can't wait to see the ocean. I haven't been in years.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you have to wait long for the next one?
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened to the car?  Did it get stolen?
I used to smoke cigarettes but I quit a few years ago. They are so bad for you.
I don't want to go to sleep yet. I want to stay up a little bit longer.
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're feeling better now. Did you go to the doctor?
No, I am not kidding you.  I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
I wish I could, but I have to go to work in a few hours. I'm so tired.
I know, I'm so ashamed of myself.  I don't know what came over me.
I changed my eating habits and started going to the gym. It was hard at first but it got easier.
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
What kind of dress was it? Was it a formal dress or more of a cocktail dress?
I know, right? I was so surprised when I saw it. I'm going to have to go there more often.
I am going on a cruise to the Bahamas in a couple of weeks.
What kind of books do you like to read? Fiction, non-fiction, biographies?
I didn't make them do anything. They did it on their own. I was so mad.
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
I know, right?  I love it.  I feel like I'm a kid again.
Oh no!  Did you wake him up?  Or did he wake up on his own?
Oh, I didn't know that. I'm not from the US, so I don't know much about it.
I know! I was so grossed out when I saw it. I had to throw it away.
I like the fact that I get to help people and make a difference in their lives. It makes me feel fulfilled.
That's all I could think of at the moment. I'm sure I'll think of more later.
That's a bummer. I hope it warms up soon so you can enjoy the outdoors.
Yeah, I think it will be a lot of fun.  I'm really looking forward to it.
I know what you mean. It's hard to find the time to do it when you have so many other things to do.
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do they hate you? Is it because of something you did?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your doctor about it? It could be a symptom of something else.
Oh wow, that's a lot of people. I'm glad he was able to make it.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I love going to bookstores. What kind of event is it?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did they call it off, if you don't mind me asking?
They do, but they also have to go to school for a long time to get to that point.
I'm sure she will! What kind of school is it, if you don't mind me asking?
I am sure you will be able to fit into it when you reach your goal weight. Good luck!
What would you like to know? I can tell you anything you want to know about it. 
Wow, congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself. I'm sure you worked hard for it.
Oh no! Did he make it on time for the rest of the date or did you have to cancel?
I bought them at a local grocery store.  I am so mad at myself right now.
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
Why do you want them to be a teacher? Do you think they would be good at it?
He came to my school to talk about his new book. I was so excited to meet him!
I would love to, but I have to drive my kids to soccer practice in the morning.
I don't know. It just won't turn on. I've tried everything I can think of.
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't being too judgmental.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go there. What are you going to do there?
I can understand that.  Kids are a lot of work.  How many do you have?
Oh no! What was wrong with your car? Did you have to take it to a mechanic?
That's a good question. I'm not sure, but I'm sure you can find a way.
No, I didn't.  I don't know what to get him.  He doesn't have a lot of money.
I'm not sure, but I'm looking forward to it. It's been a while since the last one.
I have a sore throat, cough, and runny nose.  What do you think it is?
I don't know. I just feel like something bad is going to happen. I can't shake it.
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
It was a long time ago, but I still think about it from time to time.  
I know, I hate it when people don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Iced tea is the nectar of the gods. I am so sorry for your loss.
Endorsements are when a celebrity or public figure endorses a product or service.
Do you have a source for that?  I'd like to read more about it.  
I know, but it was the first time I had seen it and I thought it was hilarious.
That's awesome! What was your favorite place you visited in each of the places you've been?
I am not, but I wish I was.  I love workshops.  What is it about?
Oh no! Did you have to go to the store to get some? I hate when that happens.
I would love to. What do you like to eat? I'm a big fan of Italian food.
I'm sure I won't, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I've got nothing to lose.
I know, I am so ashamed of myself. I don't know what I was thinking.
No, I'm taking the train. I've never been on a train before, so I'm a little nervous.
That sounds interesting. What was the name of the documentary? I'd like to check it out.
I don't know what that is, but I hope you get to download it soon! What is it for?
I love wolves, they are so majestic. Do you know what kind of wolves he lived with?
You're welcome!  +/u/dogetipbot 77.7 doge
I don't know what you're talking about.  There are only five people in this picture.
Sure, I can send them to you when I get back to my dorm. What are you studying?
What do you mean by that? I'm not trying to be rude, I just don't understand what you mean.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get along with them.
I know, but I feel like I'm being punished for something I didn't even do.
That's a lot of money! What did you do with it?    I won $1000 on a scratch off ticket once.
That's a good way to look at it. I'm going to try to keep that in mind.
That sounds like a good idea.  What kind of park are you thinking about going to? 
It was! I was so happy with how it turned out. I can't wait to make it again.
That sounds like a lot of work.  What color do you want to paint the house now?
Hi John, my name is also John.  How are you today?  Do you have any hobbies?
Did you vote for who you wanted to win or who you thought had the best chance of winning?
I'm sorry to hear that.  What are you worried about?  Is there anything I can do to help?
What does it mean? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a good person.
Do you like it?  I'm not a big fan of it, but my kids love it.
Yes, it is.  I hate driving in it.  Do you have to drive in it a lot?
No, I didn't. I'm not sure why you told me not to in the first place.
I listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite band is the Beatles. What about you?
I've never had them, but I've heard of them.  What do they taste like?
I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you will find someone. I have been looking for a long time.
That's a long shift. Do you get a lot of free time in the afternoon?
How much did you think and how much did it turn out to be? I hope it wasn't too much.
It really is. I hate doing laundry. I wish I had a washer and dryer in my apartment.
Wow, that's a lot of weight loss.  Did you do anything special to lose it?
I haven't seen my family in a long time either. I hope you get to see them soon.
I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like it's getting worse and worse.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you spoken to him about it at all?
No, it's a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to get through a maze.
I do too, but I don't want to be dependent on caffeine anymore.
Yes, I do. I work at a grocery store as a cashier. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills.
How did that go? Did you get to know each other or was it just a one time thing?
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
I did, but I didn't know what I was getting into.  I thought it was going to be a little more informative than it was.
I hate when that happens.  Did you find out what it was?  Was it a bird?
I don't really have a favorite band. I just listen to whatever is on the radio. What about you?
That's a good way to look at it. I'll try to think of it that way.
What kind of food do you like to eat? Maybe I can help you find some new recipes.
No problem. I know how hard it can be to find a good therapist. I hope you find one that works for you.
Imagination is great and all, but sometimes you just need to see it to believe it.
You can use a debit card, credit card, or a prepaid Visa card.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to make it a little better?
I'm sorry to hear that. Did you get a chance to catch up on the sleep you missed?
That sounds like a great idea! What kind of food do you like? I'm a big fan of Italian.
That's true, but I have no idea who they are. I don't even remember their names.
I'm sure it does, but you have to think about what you want to do after you graduate.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make it more comfortable for you?
I don't watch TV or listen to the radio, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling? 
Oh wow, that's exciting! What are you going to school for? Are you nervous at all?
Yes, I am looking for a job. I have been unemployed for a long time.
I'm not being sarcastic, I'm being honest.  I think it's a great idea.
Biology is a great field to go into. You can do so many things with it.
There is, but I don't have a car, so I have to rely on public transportation.
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
I don't want to be rescued. I just want to die peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather.
I teach 7th grade science.  It's a lot of work, but I love it.
How did it go?  Did you get the job?  What was the interview process like?
Oh no! I hate roaches. Have you called an exterminator to get rid of it?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
It took me about a week, but I was also working on another project at the same time.
Yes, they do.  It is very thorough.  You have to go through a metal detector and have your bags x-rayed.
It means that I am going to be a father. I am so excited and nervous at the same time.
Oh wow, that's early. Do you have to be up early for work the next day?
Me too! It's so nice to be able to relax and not have to worry about anything.
That's what I thought it was at first. I was so grossed out when I opened it.
That's true, but I don't want to have to rely on public transportation to get around.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been to a dermatologist about it?
I think it's just the lighting. It's in pretty good shape. I'm going to clean it up and use it.
I know that, but I don't know if I should get a bigger size or a smaller size.
Wow, that's a lot. What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to deal with him much longer.
You're welcome. I'm sure everything will work out for you. Just keep your head up.
That's a good idea.  I hope he doesn't try to take advantage of your kindness.
I'm the same way. I always say I'm going to do something and then never do it.
I live in a rural area, so I have to drive to the city to do anything.
Stress can cause stomach aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that could help you out?
That's a good idea.  I should do that too.  What color do you think?
I don't really have a favorite. I like them all for different reasons. What about you?
Yes, he does. I don't mind him coming over, but I wish he would clean up after himself.
Why do you think that?  Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
I don't see why not. I'm sure it would be refreshing on a hot day.
Wow, that's a lot of damage.  I hope everyone is okay.  Did you lose anything?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
Yeah, I've been busy with school and work, but I'm getting back into the swing of things.
What do you need help with?  I can try to help if I know what it is.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you gone to the doctor to see if there is anything they can do for you?
I don't know. I just can't seem to grasp the concepts as well as I should.
Do you know what they are practicing for?  I hope it's not for a game.
I've always wanted to go to one of those.  Did you have a lot of fun?
I think so too, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.
That's a lot of people.  I wonder how many of them are registered to vote.
That's what I was afraid of. Do you know what kind of bug it is so I can avoid it in the future?
I think so. We have a lot of talent on this team. We just need to stay healthy.
I didn't even know there was a movie. I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
I don't know. I just can't seem to get out of bed in the mornings.
I love italian food! What is the name of the restaurant? I would love to try it.
You have to go to the DMV and register to vote. You can do it online.
I just get on the first one I see and hope for the best. I've been lucky so far.
It's a lot of paperwork, but I think it will be worth it in the end.
It was on in the background while I was doing something else. I don't watch it much.
I would love to, but I have to work late tonight.  What movie are you going to see?
Teaching is a great profession.  What grade level do you teach?  Do you enjoy it?
I'd like to go to the beach. I haven't been in a long time. 
I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot.  I was so mad at myself.
I go to the University of Maryland, College Park in Baltimore.
You're welcome! I'm glad you had a good time. What did you guys do? 
I don't know, I just don't feel like I'm doing a good job at it.
Oh no! I hope you were able to get some sleep eventually. What time did you go to bed?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  What are you going to do?  I love the Wizard of Oz!
Do you have any advice on how I should go about it? I don't want to come off as desperate.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get out of it.
I did, but luckily I was able to hold it in until I got to my destination.
You can do it! I believe in you! Just think about how good it will feel when you get there!
I know what you mean. It's kind of a musty smell. I don't like it either.
I bet that was nice to hear.  What was the occasion?  Did you go to the ceremony?
I love Warhol. He was an American painter, photographer, and illustrator.
No, I'm training hard because I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.
They do have a left turn arrow, but people don't know how to use them. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I was starting to think I was going crazy.
I'm glad he was able to get the help he needed. I hope he's doing better now.
Oh really? I didn't know that. What kind of house are you working on right now?
It's in Los Angeles County, California. It's one of the most populous cities in the US.
No, it's a skateboard. I'm not very good at it, but it's still fun.
No, I just don't like confrontation. I don't want to have to deal with it.
Have you ever applied for a credit card before? It's a great way to build your credit.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that can help you out?
Yes it is, but I am determined to get it right this time. I don't want to go through this again.
I'm not sure yet, but I know it's going to be good.  I just know it.
How much did you think and how much did it turn out to be? I hope it wasn't too much.
What do you mean of course not? Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
I'm glad to hear that.  Did you do something nice for someone?  Or were you just being a good person?
Oh no! How did you find out? Did you tell her you didn't want her to?
Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I don't know much about that. I hope you find what you're looking for.
I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.
There will be a sign that says "wait here for the next bus" or something like that.
Thank you so much for subscribing!  I hope you enjoy it!  Do you have any favorite authors?
Parking your car is the act of parking your car on a public street or parking lot. 
I don't know, but I'm glad we haven't.  It would be a disaster.
I am, but I don't know if I'm ready for that kind of commitment yet.
I am in the same boat as you. I am trying to save up for a down payment.
That's too bad.  Where do you live?  I'm in the U.S.
That's what I'm thinking too. I think I'm going to go for it. Thanks!
That would be great, thank you so much!  I really appreciate it.  Do you have a favorite color?
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if I was overthinking it.
I don't know what to do about it. I feel like I'm going to vomit.
Oh yeah? What is it? I'm here for you. I'm a good listener.
Oh no! I hate roaches. Have you called an exterminator to get rid of it?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
Did he say what kind of pitching he was going to be doing? I hope it's softball.
I'm pretty good with computers, but I'm not sure if that's something I want to do.
Nice to meet you, Willie.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
That would be so nice of you.  I'm sure he would love that.  How old is his son?
That's what I thought, but I wasn't sure if I was imagining it or not.
I don't think I look like that, but I guess I can see why you would think that.
That's what she said!    Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  I'll show myself out.
Oh no! Were you able to salvage the meal at all or did you have to start over?
I hate when that happens.  What are you going to do for the rest of the time?
I use command strips. They work really well and don't leave any marks on the wall.
That's what she said!    I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. 
I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you get hurt?  Was anyone else involved in the accident?
I'm not trying to be mean, I just don't know what to say to her. I don't want to hurt her feelings.
I can understand that.  Do you have a dog?  They can be a great deterrent.
I'm sure I won't, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I've got nothing to lose.
Congratulations! You must be so relieved. What are you going to do now?
What kind of shoes did you get?  I love shoes.  I have a lot of them.
I bet she did.  Did you get a chance to meet her in person before the wedding?
Memorizing is a big part of it, but there is a lot more to it than that.
I know what you mean. I feel the same way. It's like you never know what's going to happen.
I'm not sure, but I hope so.  I don't want anyone to get sick.
I thought I did too, but I guess I didn't. I feel so ashamed.
Yes, we have been together for a long time.  We have been through a lot together.
Wow, congratulations! What kind of car did you get? I hope you enjoy it!
That sounds like a great idea.  Where would you like to go?  I've always wanted to go to Alaska.
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I will pay you back as soon as I can.
That's what I was thinking, but I don't know how they would have done that without me noticing.
You're welcome. I hope he does a good job. I think he has a good chance.
Likewise!  How are you?  What do you like to do in your spare time?
What kind of sweater are you looking for?  I love sweaters.  They are so cozy.
Do you have any specific ones in mind that you would like to see get funded?  
I think so too. I think it will be a lot of fun. I can't wait!
Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but I think it will be worth it in the end.
That's true, but I don't really care about that. It's the fact that she lied to me that bothers me.
Wow, that must have been quite an experience for you. Did you talk to any of them?
I hate when that happens.  What fees are you getting hit with, if you don't mind me asking?
No, I don't think so. I just don't like the idea of someone watching me.
It's a game where you have to guess the number of letters in a word or phrase.
You're welcome. I hope he does a good job. I think he has a good chance.
That's not too bad. Did you make it on time for everything else you had to do?
Of course I don't! I'll send you a message with the link. I hope you enjoy it!
No, it's a sit-down restaurant. It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.
I bet she did.  Did you get a chance to meet her in person before the wedding?
How do you like it so far? Have you played any of the other games in the series?
I have a Honda Civic.  I love it.  What about you?
You are a menace to society.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  I hope you get a ticket.
Good morning to you as well!  How are you?  Did you have a good weekend?
That's good to hear.  What's going on?  Did you have a bad day?
That's not good.  Did you change your password?  Did they get into your account?
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to relieve the pain?
No, I didn't. What happened to him? Did he make it to his destination safely?
I love the Dollar Store!  It's so cheap!  What did you buy?
My relationship with my parents is good.  They are both alive and well.  How about yours?
I hate when that happens. Did you end up getting it or did you have to go to the post office?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What did you do while you were driving around? Did you see anything interesting?
Oh no, what happened to the other one? Did you lose it, or did someone steal it?
I know what you mean. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get used to it, it's not so bad.
I hope so too, but I don't know if they will.  It's so sad.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way.  It's not that I don't want to learn, it's just that I'm afraid of public speaking.
Do you have any plans for the weekend? I'm thinking about going to the beach with some friends.
Me too, I was starting to think I was the only one with this problem. I hope they fix it soon.
Have you read it before? It's one of my favorites, I hope you enjoy it!
It was! I was so happy with how it turned out. I can't wait to make it again.
Chocolate cake is my favorite!  I love chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like chocolate cake?
Yeah, I was pretty upset about it. I don't know what I'm going to do now.
I had my first kiss when I was 14. It was with my high school sweetheart.
That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't want to look like an idiot.
I guess I don't have to, but I feel like I should. I just don't know what to do.
That's cool. Did you go to the mall? I love going to malls.
I don't know, I just don't like being out in the sun. It makes me feel sick.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you find out why it didn't go through?
I do too, but I don't want to be dependent on caffeine anymore.
What kind of sandwich are you going to make? I love grilled cheese sandwiches.
I don't have to, but I really want to. I think it will be a good experience.
Why do you say that? Do you not like the outdoors? Or do you just not like bears?
Birds can't fly. They can glide, but they can't take off from the ground.
I know, but I don't have a bathtub. I have to take showers.
I love trying new restaurants! What kind of food do you like to eat at restaurants?
I know, I feel so ashamed of myself. I'm going to try to make it up to her.
Yes, it was so hot and humid. I felt like I was going to pass out.
Wow, that's a long time.  What do you do in the meantime?  Do you have any hobbies?
I don't think so.  I think it was just a fluke.  It tasted fine.
That's a tough one. I think I'd have to go with Muhammad Ali.
What kind of puppy would you like to get?  A small one or a big one?
Oh really? What kind of sale is it? I might have to go check it out. 
I will be there for a week.  I have never been there before so I am a little nervous.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been applying to a lot of places or just a few?
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Did you have to walk around with a pen sticking out of your pants?
Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite veggies. Do you like them?
Have you ever been to the Rocky Mountains? They are the highest mountain range in North America.
I do feel good, but I don't know if I feel good enough to pay for it.
I know, right? It's like I'm the only person in the world who likes the color green.
I need you to go to the store and get me a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you wear earplugs when you go to concerts?
I did, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
Why did you get out of your car?  Were you in a hurry to get somewhere?
That's a good one. I'm glad I don't have to worry about getting sick from that anymore.
That's what I've been doing, but it's a pain in the ass to have to do that every time I put it on.
I've never had a hot dog, but I've always wanted to try one. Do you like them?
Oh no! Mosquitos are the worst. I hope they don't bother you too much.
I just need someone to talk to. I don't want to bother my friends with my problems.
That's what I'm afraid of. I don't want to pay for something I didn't do.
I would love to go with you. What are we going to do while we are out there?
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you regret it if you don't mind me asking?
I hate when that happens. Did you end up finding it or did you have to buy a new one?
I know, right?  I was like, "Wow, I didn't know you could do that."
I had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated and my blood pressure was so high.
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
That's what I'm afraid of. I don't want to pay for something I didn't do.
Due tomorrow? Do it today!  +/u/dogetipbot 100 doge verify
I am waiting for a package from amazon. It is supposed to arrive today but it hasn't yet.
I could go for a pizza right now. What kind of toppings do you like on yours?
How long does it usually take to charge it all the way? I'm thinking of getting one.
I'm sure it is, but you have to do what's best for you in the long run.
That would be great, thank you so much.  I really need to know if I need to start looking for a new place to live.
Oh no! I hope she is okay. Did she get a concussion or anything serious?
I couldn't agree more.  Children need a lot of attention and guidance.
That's what she said.    I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. 
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
It depends on where you want to go.  Do you have a destination in mind?  
I was standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was beautiful.
I'd like to go to the beach. I haven't been in a long time. 
Wow, that's a lot of bedrooms. Do you live in a mansion?
I haven't decided yet, but I think I'm going to go with the Democratic candidate.
He was a third party candidate in the 2000 presidential election. He ran on the Green Party ticket.
I would like to go to the beach. I haven't been there in a long time.
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything. Thanks!
Yes they are! I have to use the expensive stuff because my hair is so thick and curly.
I'm not sure, but I don't want to find out.  I'm so mad at him right now.
Oh no! I hope you were able to get it repaired for a reasonable price. 
That's true. It's nice to be able to talk to people from all over the world.
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. What are you studying for the test?
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I have a 10 and a 2 year old. They are a handful, but I wouldn't trade them for the world.
Yeah, sorry about that. I didn't realize how dark it was until after I took the picture.
I hate when that happens. Have you tried contacting the company to see what's going on?
I don't have to go to school anymore and I can do whatever I want. It's great.
That sounds like fun!  What are you going to see?  Is it your first time there?
It's okay. It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little bit.
I know what you mean.  I love the way my husband smells when he gets home from work.
I hate when that happens. Did you find a way to fix it or did you have to get a new one?
That's true, but there are still a lot of people who don't have access to digital broadcasts.
I think so too, but I don't want to come off as needy or clingy.

I love cats! What kind of cat do you have? Mine is a Siamese.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried online dating? It's a great way to meet new people.
I can imagine that can be stressful.  Do you have a lot of customers that treat you poorly?
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!  I hope you have a great day!  :)
Oh, that's too bad. Did you end up going somewhere else, or did you not go at all?
Why are you not sure? Is it because you don't know what you want to do with your life?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
He said it could be a number of things, but it was most likely a viral infection.
I don't know, I just don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment.
You can find them in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
I don't think so. I just don't want to waste money on something I won't eat.
I hate when that happens. Did you find a way to fix it or did you have to get a new one?
I know, I am so happy for him.  He has worked so hard to get where he is today.
What do you mean by stylish? Do you want something that looks good or something that is functional?
I don't know. I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I'm sure it will be a great home for you and your family.  I hope you get it!
I did, but I didn't get to see the movie I wanted to see because it was sold out.
I don't think it's too much at all.  It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.
Congratulations to her! What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?
About a year and a half ago. It was a very amicable divorce, though.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. What's going on?
That's a good idea. I should do that more often. Do you have any health issues?
I love cats! What kind of dog do you have? I have a golden retriever.
Pink is a great color.  I love it too.  What is your favorite color?
That's what I thought at first, but they tasted like potatoes. I was so grossed out.

That was very nice of you.  Did she like it?  What did she use it for?
What don't you understand? I'll try to explain it to you as best as I can.
I don't know, I guess I just like the feeling of the sun on my skin. 
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if I was just being paranoid.

Oh no!  I hope it's nothing serious.  I'll be praying for you.

That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was something I was missing.
Good luck! What kind of race is it? Is it a marathon or a sprint?
I love tigers! They are my favorite big cat. What is your essay about?
I have a job, I just don't make a lot of money. I'm trying to save up for a house.
That's a good thing. Savings accounts are the worst place to put your money.
Basic boards are great for beginners.  They are simple and easy to learn on.
No, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.  I think it was just a coincidence.
Oh no! Did you have to walk all the way to the next stop or did you get a ride?
That's true, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep it that way.
I don't know.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it goes.
Yes, there is a lot of things to do around here. It's a great place to live.
That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that. I guess I just don't like the way it looks.
I found it on the side of the road. I was so happy to have found it. 
I went out with one of my best friends from high school. It was a lot of fun.
I don't know what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

I am so proud of our first female president. She has done so much for women's rights.
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.
I am sure you will figure it out.  What is the asking price you have in mind?
I miss the good old days when you could just walk on the plane and not have to take off your shoes.
Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I think it was worth it in the end.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that? Is there anything I can do to help?
Well, I'm a college student studying to be a nurse. How about you? What do you do?
I think so too, but I don't want to come off as needy or clingy.
Wow, that's a long shift.  What do you do for work?  Do you get a lunch break?
I don't know how to make one. I would love to be a moderator though.
That must have been a long flight.  Did you have to get up to go to the bathroom?
It's not a B, it's a B+. It's the highest grade you can get.
I'm sure it is, but I don't have a lot of money to spend right now.
Oh my goodness, that is terrible!  Did they die?  I can't even imagine.

That's what I was thinking, but I don't know what to do with it now. 
Do you have a debit card that you can use to withdraw money from an ATM?
Eight is my favorite number as well. It is the 8th letter of the alphabet.
That's true, but you'll get used to it. Just try to make some friends and you'll be fine.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried contacting Muni to see if they know where it is?
I don't know yet, but I'm excited to find out.  I've been looking forward to it all week.
Congratulations!  Where are you going?  Is it your first time traveling internationally?
I live in an apartment complex and I don't want to disturb the neighbors.  
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I have been waiting for this day for a long time.
I hate when that happens. Did you end up getting to your destination on time at least?
Wow, that's really hot.  Do you have air conditioning in your room?  
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that too. I don't want to have to call a locksmith.
Do you have a lot of money that you need to take out? I hope you can get it all taken care of.
What do you think is incorrect about it?  I think it's a step in the right direction.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
USC as in the University of South Carolina? That's awesome! What are you studying?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is she going to be okay? Is she in the hospital?

I don't know, but I hope he gets here soon. What time is it where you are?
Yes, I did. I am glad to hear that you are doing well. Did you have a good weekend?
I don't think I'm ready for a relationship right now, but thank you for the offer.
That seems like a lot to me, but I guess it depends on the size of the city.
Yes, I do.  I speak English and Spanish fluently.  What languages do you speak?
Are they? I've never ridden in one, but I always imagined them to be uncomfortable.
That's awesome! What kind of breakfast do you get? Do you get to pick what you want?
Oh, that's cool. What are you going to be studying in the Summer courses?
That's true, but I don't know if I have it in me to go through with it.
I don't know. I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
She was mad at me for something I did. I don't even remember what it was now.
I don't want to get into specifics, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.
It does to me. I don't like being lied to, especially by someone I care about.
They can be, but they can also be a great source of companionship and entertainment.
I love to brush my teeth. It's so relaxing and I feel so clean afterwards.

I don't know. I hope not. He's a good kid. I just don't want him to get in trouble.
Yes, but I don't want to pay them anymore. I want to switch carriers.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did you get fired, if you don't mind me asking?
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What kind of bike is it?  Is it a road bike or a mountain bike?
What kind of scarf do you want to get her?  Is it cold where you live?
That sounds like a good plan.  What are you going to do with the extra $100?

That's what I've been doing, but I feel like I'm missing out on a lot.
Good luck!  I hope it works out for you.  It's a tough situation to be in.
No, I mean the one with the actors, writers, producers, and directors.
There is, but I don't want to go there. I want to make my own food.

I don't have a set date yet, but it will be in the next couple of weeks.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that could help you out?
You're welcome!  +/u/dogetipbot 77.7 doge

I have a checking account, a savings account, an investment account, and a credit card account.

I do too, but I don't have a debit card for it, so I have to go to the bank to use it.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any medicine?
That's true, but I don't really care about that. It's the fact that she lied to me that bothers me.
I know, I feel so bad about it.  I am going to make it up to him.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't want to get too close to find out.
I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that.  I won't do it again.

Chocolate cake is my favorite!  I love chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like chocolate cake?

That's not too bad. Did you make it on time for everything else you had to do?
I am sorry to hear that.  What did you do to make him say that?  
No problem. I know how hard it can be to find a good therapist. I hope you find one that works for you.
Why not? Who are you going to vote for, if you don't mind me asking?

I'm not sure where you can buy one, but you can get a free one if you have a student ID.

I love cats! What kind of dog do you have? I have a golden retriever.

That's great! I'm glad you were able to find a copy. I hope you enjoy it!

I don't know. I just can't seem to grasp the concepts as well as I should.
Dirty old men are the best kind of men. They know what they want and they get it.
I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot.  I was so mad at myself.
Okay, I'm sitting down.  What do you want to talk about?  Do you have any hobbies?
What would you like to know? I can tell you anything you want to know about it. 
That's what I was thinking. I got a ticket for parking in a handicap spot and it was over $300.
I think so too. I think it will be a lot of fun. I can't wait!
That's a good idea.  I should do that too.  What color do you think?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
No, I am not kidding you.  I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
No, it's a skateboard. I'm not very good at it, but it's still fun.
I know, I just don't like them crawling on me when I'm trying to sleep.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. What are you sick with?
Oh wow, what kind of cake was it?  Was it a special occasion or something?
USC as in the University of South Carolina? That's awesome! What are you studying?
I'm sure it does, but you have to think about what you want to do after you graduate.
What would you do if you found out that you were the reincarnation of someone famous?
That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that. I guess I just don't like the way it looks.
It's in Los Angeles County, California. It's one of the most populous cities in the US.
I did, but luckily I was able to hold it in until I got to my destination.
I am sure you will do great.  Just be yourself and be confident.  You got this!
Oh wow, that's a long time to be on a plane.  Where are you going?
Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's going to burn your house down! With the lemons!
Basic boards are great for beginners.  They are simple and easy to learn on.
Yeah, I was pretty upset about it. I don't know what I'm going to do now.
Orange is my favorite color. I was so happy when I found out it wasn't orange.
I am so sorry to hear that. Are you going to keep it or give it up for adoption?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you gone to the doctor to see if there is anything they can do for you?
That's what I'm thinking. I'm going to call them tomorrow and see what's going on.
I hate when that happens.  Did you find out what it was?  Was it a bird?
That's a good idea. I'll do that next time I see him. I'm sure he'll appreciate it.
Do you have any pets?  I have a cat and a dog.  I love them.
Wow, congratulations! You must be very proud of yourself. I'm sure you worked hard for it.
Wow, that's a lot. What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.  I think they're the same, but I'm not sure.
Oh no! What was wrong with your car? Did you have to take it to a mechanic?
I'm not sure, but I do know that they have to pay for them.  I don't think they get them for free.
I know what you mean.  I have a lot of homework too.  Do you like school?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any hobbies to keep you occupied?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're feeling better now. Did you go to the doctor?
I would love to, but I have to work late tonight.  What movie are you going to see?
I have a sore throat, cough, and runny nose.  What do you think it is?
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if I was overthinking it.
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
That's true, but I have no idea who they are. I don't even remember their names.
I am waiting for a package from amazon. It is supposed to arrive today but it hasn't yet.
I was chewing gum, but I had to spit it out. It was so gross.
Yes, it does.  Did you have a good time?  What was your favorite part?
That's true, but I don't really care about that. It's the fact that she lied to me that bothers me.
No, it was a black ball.  I hit it straight down the middle of the fairway.
Oh really? What's the announcement? I hope it's good news!  +/u/dogetipbot 20 doge
What was the question?  Maybe I can help you find it.  What was it about?
No, it's a sit-down restaurant. It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.
That sounds like a good plan.  What are you going to do with the extra $100?
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I'm sure it is, but I don't have a lot of money to spend right now.
That is very true. I am glad I didn't go through with it. It would have been a disaster.
That's a good idea. I should do that more often. Do you have any health issues?
What kind of puppy would you like to get?  A small one or a big one?
Likewise!  How are you?  What do you like to do in your spare time?
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
That's what I was afraid of. Do you know what kind of bug it is so I can avoid it in the future?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried different strains? Some are more stimulating than others.
That sounds interesting. What was the name of the documentary? I'd like to check it out.
Why do you think that?  Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it? I'm here for you.
Did you say anything to her? How did it make you feel to bump into her like that?
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened to the car?  Did it get stolen?
That's a lot of money to put down.  I don't think I would be able to do that.
I'm not a republican, I'm a libertarian, but I agree with you.
I am, I just don't want to get my hopes up too much. I've been let down before.
What kind of pencil is it? Is it a mechanical pencil or a wooden one?
No, I am not.  I am terrible at math.  It is my worst subject.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that? Is there anything I can do to help?
I know it is, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that too. I don't want to have to call a locksmith.
I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm living up to my full potential.
You're welcome!  +/u/dogetipbot 77.7 doge
I know, but some are worse than others. I'm trying to watch what I eat, so I don't want to overindulge.
Yes, it does.  I don't know what I'm going to do with myself now.
No, I just don't want to go. I don't like being around a lot of people.
I think it's just the lighting. It's in pretty good shape. I'm going to clean it up and use it.
Oh no!  Did you have to clean it up?  Was it hard to clean up?
I love Warhol. He was an American painter, photographer, and illustrator.
You must be so proud of your son. I'm sure he's a great athlete.

He was a third party candidate in the 2000 presidential election. He ran on the Green Party ticket.
Oh no! Did you have to go to the store to get some? I hate when that happens.
No, I didn't. I don't want her to feel like she has to go to college right away.
I listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite band is the Beatles. What about you?
Oh, I see. Thank you for the clarification. Do you know when the vote will be held?
I love it too, but I hate shoveling it out of my driveway. 
Oh no! I hope you were able to get it repaired for a reasonable price. 
It's a game where you have to guess the number of letters in a word or phrase.
Congratulations to her! What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?
Oh no! Mosquitos are the worst. I hope they don't bother you too much.
What don't you understand? I'll try to explain it to you as best as I can.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was anything else I should do first.
How much did you think and how much did it turn out to be? I hope it wasn't too much.
Nice to meet you, Willie.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
I'm sure she will! What kind of school is it, if you don't mind me asking?
I hate when that happens. Did you end up getting it or did you have to go to the post office?
Wow, that's a lot of money. What are you going to do with all that money?
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?  Do you enjoy it?
I know that, but I don't know if I should get a bigger size or a smaller size.
That's a good reason. Do you have a car or do you rely on public transportation?
You're welcome! I'm sure you do, you seem like a very caring person. 
What kind of calling card do you use? Like a business card, or a personalized one?
That's a good problem to have.  You can always make more money, but you can't always buy a better house.

What kind of job are you looking for? I hope you are able to find one soon. 
Good morning to you as well!  How are you?  Did you have a good weekend?

I bet she did.  Did you get a chance to meet her in person before the wedding?
Yes, it does.  Did you have a good time?  What was your favorite part?
No, I've had it for a few years now. It's just been sitting in my closet.
He did, but I can't remember what it was. I think it was in the afternoon.
Oh no! How did you find out? Did you tell her you didn't want her to?
I love wolves, they are so majestic. Do you know what kind of wolves he lived with?
It was on in the background while I was doing something else. I don't watch it much.
What do you need help with? I can try to help you if I know what you need.
I had my first kiss when I was 14. It was with my high school sweetheart.
I'm not rejecting you, I just don't know you well enough to date you. 
I hate when that happens. Did you end up finding it or did you have to buy a new one?
It's a card that you can use to pay for things with your phone. It's really convenient.
Hi lisa, my name is lucy, nice to meet you. Do you have any hobbies?
I haven't seen my family in a long time either. I hope you get to see them soon.
That's great to hear. How long have you been married and how many kids do you have?
Wow, that's a long time! What do you do for the company, if you don't mind me asking?
How did that go? Did you get to know each other or was it just a one time thing?
What kind of chips are we talking about here? I'm a Doritos man myself.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite veggies. Do you like them?
That's a good way to look at it. I'm going to try to keep that in mind.
No, I didn't. I'm not sure why you told me not to in the first place.
What time do you have to go to bed to be able to wake up at that time in the morning?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that could help you out?
I'm sorry to hear that. How come it was too long? Did you not enjoy it?
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I have been waiting for this day for a long time.
That sounds like fun!  What are you going to see?  Is it your first time there?
You'll have to trust me on that one.  I've been doing this for a long time.
You can find them in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds.
I don't know, I'm not a designer.  I just know that it doesn't look good to me.
I couldn't agree more.  Children need a lot of attention and guidance.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you find a new one soon.
I'm sure it will be a great home for you and your family.  I hope you get it!
Do you have any pets?  I have a dog and a cat.  I love them so much.
I love to brush my teeth. It's so relaxing and I feel so clean afterwards.
Well, I'm a college student studying to be a nurse. How about you? What do you do?
I don't have to, but I really want to. I think it will be a good experience.
I know, right?  I love it.  I feel like I'm a kid again.
Good luck!  I hope it works out for you.  It's a tough situation to be in.
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I was starting to think I was going crazy.
I could go for a pizza right now. What kind of toppings do you like on yours?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find what you're looking for. What are you looking for?
She has a lot of pain in her abdomen and back. She also has a fever.
It's cold and white and fluffy.  I love it.  Where do you live?
I do feel good, but I don't know if I feel good enough to pay for it.
I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to explode. I can't take it anymore.
What kind of stock did you buy? Did you buy it because you think it will go up in value?
That's great! What kind of business are you going to be starting? I wish you the best of luck!
Do you know how much it would cost to replace the brakes?  I don't want to get ripped off.
Why do you hate flying?  I love it.  Flying is one of the safest ways to travel.
I don't know about you, but I sure as hell didn't have one in my school.
I don't know. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of commitment.
I don't work at home. I work in an office. I just don't have to commute.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
Yes, that would be very useful.  Do you speak more than one language?  What languages do you speak?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried contacting Muni to see if they know where it is?
I do too.  They are one of my favorite bands.  Do you have a favorite song?
That's what she said!    I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. 
That's true, but I don't want to have to rely on public transportation to get around.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get it soon so you can enjoy it.
I hate when that happens. Did you have a lot of contacts on your old phone? 
Yeah, I was a little worried about that, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
That's awesome! What kind of music do you like? I'm a big fan of country music.
That's a good thing. Savings accounts are the worst place to put your money.
I know, but it was the first time I had seen it and I thought it was hilarious.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you have to wait long for the next one?
Wow, that must have been quite an experience for you. Did you talk to any of them?
I don't really have a date in mind. I just want to get away for a while.
I can understand that.  Do you have a dog?  They can be a great deterrent.
I don't watch TV or listen to the radio, so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Yes, I do.  I speak English and Spanish fluently.  What languages do you speak?
That's not good. You should probably go to the doctor to make sure it's not something serious.
Oh, that's cool. What are you going to be studying in the Summer courses?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that can help you out?
That sounds like a lot of fun! What did you do while you were driving around? Did you see anything interesting?
I think so. We have a lot of talent on this team. We just need to stay healthy.
I did, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
That was nice of her.  What kind of soup was it?  Did he like it?
That seems like a lot to me, but I guess it depends on the size of the city.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to pay too much for it.
That's really nice of them.  Did you have a good time at the reunion?
Do you have any siblings? I have two brothers and we all have the same middle name.

Oh no! I hope no one gets hurt. Did they catch the perpetrator yet?
That's not how gravity works. Gravity is caused by the curvature of spacetime.
It was a long time ago, but I still think about it from time to time.  
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you have to stay an hour longer than you planned?
Wow, that's a lot of money.  What kind of guns are they?  Do you like them?
No, I just don't like confrontation. I don't want to have to deal with it.
Yeah, sorry about that. I didn't realize how dark it was until after I took the picture.
I don't know what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
Oh no! I hope it's not too bad. Are you going to evacuate?
No, I'm agreeing with you. I was just adding on to what you were saying.
I love italian food! What is the name of the restaurant? I would love to try it.
I want to be an English teacher. I love reading and writing, so I think it will be a good fit for me.
I'm sorry officer, I didn't know I couldn't do that.  I won't do it again.
I changed my eating habits and started going to the gym. It was hard at first but it got easier.
Oh my goodness, that is terrible!  Did they die?  I can't even imagine.
I can't believe it's been that long. It feels like it was just a few years ago.
I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.  I think they're the same, but I'm not sure.
I know, right?  I wish there was a way to send them back to the womb.
No, I didn't.  I don't know what to get him.  He doesn't have a lot of money.
Why do you want them to be a teacher? Do you think they would be good at it?
Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be a lot worse.
I am so proud of our first female president. She has done so much for women's rights.
Iced tea is the nectar of the gods. I am so sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry to hear that. Chemistry is tough. Did you have a good teacher?
It's not a B, it's a B+. It's the highest grade you can get.
I'm not sure, but I don't want to find out.  I'm so mad at him right now.
How did it go?  Did you get the job?  What was the interview process like?
Yeah, I was surprised too. I guess it makes sense though, since it's the same company.
I know what you mean. I feel the same way. It's like you never know what's going to happen.
Excuses for what?  I'm not making any excuses for anything.  What are you talking about?
It depends on where you work.  Some places give you an hour, some give you two fifteen minute breaks.
I know, I was so disappointed in myself. I'm going to have to do better next time.
That sounds like a great idea.  Where would you like to go?  I've always wanted to go to Alaska.
Yeah, I've been busy with school and work, but I'm getting back into the swing of things.
I've been here for about a year and a half. It's a great place to live.
I try not to, but sometimes it's unavoidable. I try to be the bigger person.
I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like it's getting worse and worse.
That's what she said!    Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  I'll show myself out.
I don't know what you're talking about.  There are only five people in this picture.
I have a job, I just don't make a lot of money. I'm trying to save up for a house.
Yes, I did. I am glad to hear that you are doing well. Did you have a good weekend?
I did, but I didn't get to see the movie I wanted to see because it was sold out.
Oh wow, congratulations! How long have you two been together? Are you nervous?
What do you think is incorrect about it?  I think it's a step in the right direction.
That sounds like a great idea! I love attics, they're so cozy and warm.
I don't know what to do about it. I feel like I'm going to vomit.
I just get on the first one I see and hope for the best. I've been lucky so far.
That sounds like a fun trip. What are you planning to do while you're out there? 
I'm glad to hear that.  Did you do something nice for someone?  Or were you just being a good person?
I don't have to prove anything to you. I know what I know and you know what you know.
Oh no! Did you have to walk all the way to the next stop or did you get a ride?
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
I don't know what to tell you then.  I've never had that happen to me.
I live with my parents and they don't want me going out at night. I'm only 17.
That's what I'm thinking, but I don't want to come off as clingy.
How old are you? He's only a year and a half, but he's a big boy!
Oh, well that's good.  I'm glad she's trying to take care of it.
I didn't even know there was a movie. I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
I have no idea. It's been like that for years. I think they just don't care.
Do you have any pets?  I have a cat and a dog.  I love them so much.
Why did you get out of your car?  Were you in a hurry to get somewhere?
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was something I was missing.
That's what I've been doing, but it's a pain in the ass to have to do that every time I put it on.
Thunder is the sound produced by lightning. I love thunderstorms. 
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
I do too, but I don't trust it 100% of the time.  It's nice to have a backup.
I miss the good old days when you could just walk on the plane and not have to take off your shoes.
I didn't even think of that! Thank you so much for the suggestion, I will definitely try that!
I washed a pair of jeans that I had worn for the first time in a while.
I do too. It's nice to be able to see the stars and the milky way.
No, they are over the counter.  You can get them at any pharmacy.
That's true, but I don't think I've ever seen a snake in my neighborhood.
I don't know. I think I would prefer to be alone, but at the same time I feel lonely.
I know!  I was so mad.  I don't know what I'm going to do.
I do too, but I don't want to be dependent on caffeine anymore.
Why don't you like your picture? Is it because you don't think you look good in it?
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.  Do you have any special traditions for it?
I've never had a hot dog, but I've always wanted to try one. Do you like them?
I don't know, but I will try to call it as soon as I get home from work.
I bought a new car.  I am so excited about it!  I can't wait to drive it!
Do you like it?  I'm not a big fan of it, but my kids love it.
That's what I'm leaning towards. I don't want to deal with the hassle.
I didn't do anything. I was so ashamed of myself. I don't know what I was thinking.
Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I think it was worth it in the end.
Do you like it?  I'm not a big fan of it, but my kids love it.
Yes. Opera is a type of musical theatre that originated in Italy.
Yes, I can write you a letter of recommendation.  What do you need it for?
Aww, that's so sweet! How long have you two been together now?   
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get out of it.
Teaching is a great profession.  What grade level do you teach?  Do you enjoy it?
Do you have any advice on how I should go about it? I don't want to come off as desperate.
I am sure you will figure it out.  What is the asking price you have in mind?
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did they call it off, if you don't mind me asking?
I hate when that happens. Did you find a way to fix it or did you have to get a new one?
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
Yes, I agree.  I am so ready to move on with my life and start a new chapter.
What kind of table are you looking to get?  I need to get a new one myself.
I don't want to walk all the way to the bathroom just to find out that I'm out of tissues.
I don't understand why they would want to do that. Pit bulls are great dogs.
Birds can't fly. They can glide, but they can't take off from the ground.
I use command strips. They work really well and don't leave any marks on the wall.
Oh no!  Did you miss your stop?  I hope you were able to catch the next one.
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure.  Thanks for the reply!
Oh yeah? What is it? I'm here for you. I'm a good listener.
Oh wow, that's a lot of people. I'm glad he was able to make it.
I don't have to go to school anymore and I can do whatever I want. It's great.
They are for my grandmother. She is in a nursing home and I miss her a lot.

That sounds like a lot of fun!  What are you going to do?  I love the Wizard of Oz!
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Did you go to the doctor?
Oh no! Did he make it on time for the rest of the date or did you have to cancel?
I agree, it's nice to have a good relationship with your landlord. It makes life so much easier.
What does it mean? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a good person.
That's not too bad. Did you make it on time for everything else you had to do?
Chocolate cake is my favorite!  I love chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like chocolate cake?
No, I did them all on my own.  It was a lot of fun.  I was sore the next day though.
They can do a lot of things. They can canvass, phonebank, or facebank.
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
Eight is my favorite number as well. It is the 8th letter of the alphabet.
I don't know. I was so mad. I had to call my husband to calm me down.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is she going to be okay? Is she in the hospital?
I don't want to get into specifics, but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.
Milk is a good source of calcium, vitamin D, and protein.
It's also a law that you have to have an ID to buy alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.
Pink is a great color.  I love it too.  What is your favorite color?
It depends on where you want to go.  Do you have a destination in mind?  
I hope you're right. I've been studying a lot, but I'm still nervous.
Are they? I've never ridden in one, but I always imagined them to be uncomfortable.
You're welcome. I hope he does a good job. I think he has a good chance.
I'm going to the beach! I can't wait to see the ocean. I haven't been in years.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope they get resolved for you soon. What's going on?
I hope so too. I've been looking forward to them for a long time. I can't wait to wear them.
No, I mean the one with the actors, writers, producers, and directors.
What kind of lunch do you want to get? I love a good ham and cheese sandwich.
That's pretty much it.  It was a good day.  I got to spend time with my family.
Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but I think it will be worth it in the end.
I am so happy for you! What are you going to do with your new house?  
What made you think it was going to be harder than it turned out to be, if you don't mind me asking?

Why do you say that? Do you not like the outdoors? Or do you just not like bears?
Oh, that's too bad. Maybe you can find someone to drive you there? Or take a bus?
Yes, it is.  I hate driving in it.  Do you have to drive in it a lot?
Yes, it is a 24 hour diner.  It is the only one in the area that is open that late.
I would love to go with you. What are we going to do while we are out there?
That's part of it. The other part is that I just don't feel like doing anything.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. What's going on?
Are you sure it's not just your imagination? I've heard that can be a symptom of schizophrenia.

I know, right? It's crazy to think that it's been around since the Paleolithic era!
I know what you mean. It's kind of a musty smell. I don't like it either.

No, they are over the counter.  You can get them at any pharmacy.
I didn't make them do anything. They did it on their own. I was so mad.
Oh no!  How did that happen?  Did you have to go to the ER?
I don't know what to do about it. I feel like I'm going to vomit.
Yes, I do. I work at a grocery store as a cashier. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills.
I don't know, I just feel like I should be doing something more productive with my time.
I miss the good old days when you could just walk on the plane and not have to take off your shoes.

I have a job, I just don't make a lot of money. I'm trying to save up for a house.
I love it too, but I hate shoveling it out of my driveway. 
I know what you mean. I live in an apartment and the walls are paper thin. I can hear everything my neighbors do.
Neighbors can be a pain in the ass sometimes. Do you live in an apartment or a house?

That's a good idea. I'll do that next time I see him. I'm sure he'll appreciate it.
Why do you say that? Do you not like the outdoors? Or do you just not like bears?
That's exactly how I installed it. It was a pain in the ass, but it worked.
No, I mean the one with the actors, writers, producers, and directors.
Thank you so much for subscribing!  I hope you enjoy it!  Do you have any favorite authors?
That sounds like a lot of work.  What color do you want to paint the house now?
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Did you find out why it didn't go through?
I'm not a big baseball fan, so I didn't go.  I'm sure it was fun though.
Are you sure it's not just your imagination? I've heard that can be a symptom of schizophrenia.

No, I'm taking the train. I've never been on a train before, so I'm a little nervous.

I don't know. I just can't seem to get out of bed in the mornings.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't do anything right. I just want to give up.
What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
Oh no! I hope you were able to get some sleep eventually. What time did you go to bed?

Baseball is a great sport. I love it too. Do you have a favorite team?
It was! I was so happy with how it turned out. I can't wait to make it again.

I'm not sure what you mean. Do you have a table you want me to look at?
I know, I feel so bad about it.  I am going to make it up to him.
That's so nice of you. I wish I had someone like that in my life right now.

I've always wanted to go to one of those.  Did you have a lot of fun?
It means that I am going to be a father. I am so excited and nervous at the same time.
No, I didn't.  I don't know what to get him.  He doesn't have a lot of money.
Yes, it is.  I hate driving in it.  Do you have to drive in it a lot?
I didn't even think of that! Thank you so much for the suggestion, I will definitely try that!
Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting it to be a lot worse.

I'm the same way. I like to be able to do what I want when I want.
I hate when that happens. Did you find a way to fix it or did you have to get a new one?
Anything you want. I'm not picky. I just want to be with my family. 
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to make it a little better?
I did, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

I know, but it was the first time I had seen it and I thought it was hilarious.
Oh no, what happened?  Did you get in trouble with your boss?  I hate when that happens.
I can understand that.  Do you have a dog?  They can be a great deterrent.
Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Did you have to walk around with a pen sticking out of your pants?
I bought them at a local grocery store.  I am so mad at myself right now.

I try not to, but sometimes it's unavoidable. I try to be the bigger person.
That sounds like a lot of fun! I've always wanted to go there. What are you going to do there?
Yes, I did. It was a good workout. I was sore the next day.
What time do you have to go to bed to be able to wake up at that time in the morning?
Yes, I am looking for a job. I have been unemployed for a long time.
Good luck!  I hope it works out for you.  It's a tough situation to be in.
I'm not rejecting you, I just don't know you well enough to date you.

I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it? I'm here for you.
I don't know what you're talking about.  There are only five people in this picture.
I don't know what that is, but I hope you get to download it soon! What is it for?
Really? That would be great! I've always wanted to learn how to play the violin.
Oh, I didn't know that. I guess I'll have to find something else to do.

It depends on where you want to go.  Do you have a destination in mind?  
Do you have any advice on how I should go about it? I don't want to come off as desperate.
Are they? I've never ridden in one, but I always imagined them to be uncomfortable.
I know, right?  I wish there was a way to send them back to the womb.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it!  I hope you have a great day!  :)

I did, but luckily I was able to hold it in until I got to my destination.

That's a good way to look at it. I'll try to think of it that way.
He really does. I'm so thankful to have him in my life. He's my best friend.

I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.

You're welcome!  +/u/dogetipbot 77.7 doge

I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find the right person for you soon.  
That's a lot of people.  I wonder how many of them are registered to vote.
What do you mean by safe area? Do you mean a place where there is little to no crime?

I don't think that's true. I think it's just that some people are scumbags.
Oh no! I hope you feel better soon! Drink lots of water and get some rest!

What kind of dress was it? Was it a formal dress or more of a cocktail dress?

I don't know, I just don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment.

I need you to go to the store and get me a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread.
I know, I just don't like them crawling on me when I'm trying to sleep.
Yes, that would be very useful.  Do you speak more than one language?  What languages do you speak?
Dirty old men are the best kind of men. They know what they want and they get it.

No, I am not kidding you.  I have been looking forward to this for a long time.
Why are you not sure? Is it because you don't know what you want to do with your life?
I would love to go with you. What are we going to do while we are out there?
I love to brush my teeth. It's so relaxing and I feel so clean afterwards.
Yeah, I think it will be a lot of fun.  I'm really looking forward to it.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it works out for you. What are you waiting for?
Wow, that's a long time.  What do you do in the meantime?  Do you have any hobbies?

He did, but I can't remember what it was. I think it was in the afternoon.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't want to get too close to find out.

No, I'm training hard because I want to be the very best, like no one ever was.

It depends on where you work.  Some places give you an hour, some give you two fifteen minute breaks.
He came to my school to talk about his new book. I was so excited to meet him!
Wow, that's a long shift.  What do you do for work?  Do you get a lunch break?
Wow, that must have been quite an experience for you. Did you talk to any of them?
No, I just don't like confrontation. I don't want to have to deal with it.
That sounds like a lot of work. Why do you want to do that, if you don't mind me asking?
I hate when that happens. Did you end up finding it or did you have to buy a new one?
That's what I was thinking, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't being too judgmental.
I don't think so.  I think it was just a fluke.  It tasted fine.
I've never had them, but I've heard of them.  What do they taste like?
I hope so too. I've been looking forward to them for a long time. I can't wait to wear them.
I'm sure you'll get an A if you put in the work. I believe in you!
You're welcome! I'm glad you had a good time. What did you guys do? 
I don't know. I just feel like something bad is going to happen. I can't shake it.
It's supposed to be sunny and in the 70s. I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, I see. I'm sorry, I don't know much about that. I hope you find what you're looking for.
USC as in the University of South Carolina? That's awesome! What are you studying?
The Affordable Care Act is an American health care law enacted by Barack Obama in 2008.
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that too. I don't want to have to call a locksmith.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did you get fired, if you don't mind me asking?
Leftovers are the best.  What do you do with them?  Do you just throw them out?
I don't know what to tell you then.  I've never had that happen to me.
I love camping! I am going to the beach with my family. I hope you have fun!
Yes, I scored in the 98th percentile on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
I know, right?  It's so hard to pick just one.  They're all so good.
I bet that was nice to hear.  What was the occasion?  Did you go to the ceremony?
Are you going to tell me what you want to do to me? I like it when you do that.
I have a Honda Civic.  I love it.  What about you?
I can imagine that can be stressful.  Do you have a lot of customers that treat you poorly?
How do you like it so far? Have you played any of the other games in the series?
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any medicine?
I hope so too, but I don't know if they will.  It's so sad.
I have a sore throat, cough, and runny nose.  What do you think it is?
It's a lot of paperwork, but I think it will be worth it in the end.
I know, I was so ashamed of myself.  I had no idea what I was doing.
I've never been there, but I've heard it's beautiful. What do you like about it?
That's a good idea. I should do that more often. Do you have any health issues?
Nice to meet you, Willie.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
That was very nice of you.  Did she like it?  What did she use it for?
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking? I work in IT.
I don't know what to tell you then.  I've never had that happen to me.
That's not good. You should probably go to the doctor to make sure it's not something serious.
I don't remember exactly, but it was a lot.  I was so mad at myself.
No, it's a puzzle game where you have to figure out how to get through a maze.
No, it was a black ball.  I hit it straight down the middle of the fairway.
It's okay. It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little bit.
Yes, I am sure that is all.  I have been waiting for this day for a long time.
That's what I was thinking, but I don't know what to do with it now. 
There will be a sign that says "wait here for the next bus" or something like that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you regret it if you don't mind me asking?
Yes, he does. I don't mind him coming over, but I wish he would clean up after himself.
That sounds like a great idea.  I hope it works out for you.  What are you running for?
I do feel good, but I don't know if I feel good enough to pay for it.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends or family that can help you out?
I don't think so. I just don't want to waste money on something I won't eat.
There is, but I don't want to go there. I want to make my own food.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was something I was missing.
I don't really have a date in mind. I just want to get away for a while.
Why do you say that? It's been raining here for the past couple of days. 
I wish I could, but I have to go to work in a few hours. I'm so tired.
What kind of shoes did you get?  I love shoes.  I have a lot of them.
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.  Do you have any special traditions for it?
I am so happy for you! What are you going to do with your new house?  
I know what you mean. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get used to it, it's not so bad.
Oh really? What's the announcement? I hope it's good news!  +/u/dogetipbot 20 doge
Wow, congratulations! What kind of car did you get? I hope you enjoy it!
Paper cuts are the worst! I hope it heals quickly for you. Are you going to the doctor?
Oh wow, that's exciting! What are you going to school for? Are you nervous at all?
It's also a law that you have to have an ID to buy alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.
No, I didn't. I'm not sure why you told me not to in the first place.
I used to, but not so much anymore.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe I should start again.
I use command strips. They work really well and don't leave any marks on the wall.
No, I am not.  I am terrible at math.  It is my worst subject.
Oh wow, that's a lot of people. I'm glad he was able to make it.
Oh no! Were you able to salvage the meal at all or did you have to start over?
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
That's pretty much it.  It was a good day.  I got to spend time with my family.
I guess I don't have to, but I feel like I should. I just don't know what to do.
That sounds like a great idea.  Where would you like to go?  I've always wanted to go to Alaska.
What kind of sandwich are you going to make? I love grilled cheese sandwiches.
There is, but I don't have a car, so I have to rely on public transportation.
I haven't tried it yet. I don't know if I want to. I'm afraid it will make me sick.
That's awesome! What was your favorite place you visited in each of the places you've been?
No, I just don't want to go. I don't like being around a lot of people.
I don't think I look like that, but I guess I can see why you would think that.
I just get on the first one I see and hope for the best. I've been lucky so far.
Why would I lie about something like that? It's not like I'm going to get anything out of it.
I know it is, but I don't know what to do about it. I feel so ashamed.
I don't know what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I hate when that happens. Have you tried contacting the company to see what's going on?
Oh no! I hope she is okay. Did she get a concussion or anything serious?
That is a good thing.  How much money will he save?  Is it a lot?
That's true, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep it that way.
Wow, that's a lot of money. What are you going to do with all that money?
I teach 7th grade science.  It's a lot of work, but I love it.
That's a good thing. Savings accounts are the worst place to put your money.
I am sorry to hear that.  What happened to the car?  Did it get stolen?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any hobbies to keep you occupied?
Yes, it can be very slippery, especially if it is raining or snowing.
I have a chihuahua.  I love him so much.  What about you?
Me too, I was starting to think I was the only one with this problem. I hope they fix it soon.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was anything else I should do first.
I don't know how to make one. I would love to be a moderator though.
Yes, I agree.  I am so ready to move on with my life and start a new chapter.
Chocolate cake is my favorite!  I love chocolate cake with vanilla frosting.  Do you like chocolate cake?
Hi lisa, my name is lucy, nice to meet you. Do you have any hobbies?
Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's going to burn your house down! With the lemons!
No, I've had it for a few years now. It's just been sitting in my closet.
It's a card that you can use to pay for things with your phone. It's really convenient.
Why don't you like your picture? Is it because you don't think you look good in it?
My relationship with my parents is good.  They are both alive and well.  How about yours?
I did. I had to call a locksmith to come and open it for me.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
Yes, they do. Especially when you have to wait for someone to come and get it for you.
That's what I was afraid of. Do you know what kind of bug it is so I can avoid it in the future?
I don't know. I just don't feel like it. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.  I think they're the same, but I'm not sure.
That's exciting! What are you going to do with your free time now that you don't have to study?
That's what I was thinking, but I don't know how they would have done that without me noticing.
I know, I was so ashamed of myself. I will never make that mistake again.
I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
About an hour and a half. I can't wait. I'm going to get a burrito.
Do you have any pets?  I have a cat and a dog.  I love them so much.
What kind of puppy would you like to get?  A small one or a big one?
Yeah, it was a lot of work, but I think it was worth it in the end.
I had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated and my blood pressure was so high.
