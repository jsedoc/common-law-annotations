i meant to say your arms should be at 10 and 2, on top of your head.
some clothes. they are clean now.
that'll be great! i've never played a card game.
i know. but you know what's even worse? doing the laundry and then having to deal with someone doing the dishes. that's just a no from me dawg!!
oh i did use my imagination! i imagined it was a cloud, with the dark side facing me, so i could see it. i also imagined that the water was moving as though it were ripples in the ocean. it was pretty cool.
not really. we're pretty close. how many in your group?
yeah i just hate the feeling of failure.
oh no, is she ok? how did she fall?
they probably have a lot of tickets to give to people.
oh okay. so what are you going to do with the extra pair then?
no. three seems about right. i'd hate to be in a group where more is not desired.
i will call the muni and see where it is.
the fact that we may not be able to get out. it is very dangerous.
she thinks i'm going out too much.
maybe somebody found it and returned it to you. do you know anyone who may have lost it?
that's true. but they can start drinking at any age.
i've had the same problems. we're working on fixes for that. what kind of fees are you having?
i'd probably just eat the crumbs.
yes they do! it's so exciting to see. do you like watching people decorate?
oh, i'm sorry. did you show the cop your speeding ticket and how fast you were going?
oh no, i'm so sorry you were robbed
oh, that's a nice gift! what sweater will it be?
oh no! i am sorry to hear that. does he have to go to the er?
i'd love to say that i have a favorite, but there are so many good ones. i like the older games the most.
how old is spotty? it depends what kind of dog it is. they have different lifespans.
that's a lot of people to get on a plane at one time.
ohhh, what is the announcement?
oh, i've never been to a bookstore!
i will be there for 3 nights. what are you charging for the room?
no she knows i'm in college.
ok i am going to have some questions then. how many do you have right now?
i did. what happened to the six men?
awesome. i will bring some snacks.
i'm here. where is the workshop taking place?
well if i had to guess, i'd say it was something you ate.
well what bus is closest to your home? i will get you back home.
me either. speech is the class that really helps you get a job. i am glad i did it!
we could go to the beach. there are so many places to go.
i would not have passed it, you never know when the cops are gonna pull you over
i'd have a piece. do you like the dessert better than the meal?
no, i haven't got a pamphlet for anything in the mail for the last year. i don't even know when i get mail anymore.
i'm not certain, but it looks more like a club for playing billiards. golf clubs are typically much larger and have a much longer handle.
i see. i have a bunch of online accounts. i like facebook and instagram. they allow me to connect with friends.
do you want to buy a membership card for the store that is located in your area?
it doesn't look corned to me. it has no labels. i think i'm going to throw it out and eat my vegetables instead.
i applied to 8 schools.
the symptoms are i can hardly move and i've a terrible headache
i just want to be at home all day.
i am really, you seem nice
oh sorry, maybe you should ask the librarian nicely then.
ah, ok. how much luggage is it?
you need to practice more. how is your hand now?
sure. but first you have to tell me what the opinion is.
is the pain from the accident or from the neck pain?
oh wow. you must have a lot of free time. i watched it once.
i love the colorful equipment, too!
i always heard that you should never leave your valuables inside your car at any time!
the walls are the only thin in my house
i am a male from the south. do you like it down here?
he was at a local restaurant that i frequent.
i'm glad mr. johnson was able to make it. i was concerned. i know you guys are understaffed. i'll be sure to get you guys some good tips in the mail.
oh. that's not bad! i thought it was more often
but it needs to be a good picture right?
that's the going rate for a used game. i don't have much. i'm trying to raise funds so i can move to a new apartment.
i understand they need to take care of their kids, but at the same time, my kids don't need to hear about my divorce or my kids going out with friends.
that would be a nice gift. but, i am sure he would prefer you just spent the time with him and not baking.
about 10 minutes. are you hungry now, too?
wow that's a long time. were you tired?
i don't like to talk about it. did the current tenant maintain it well?
sorry to hear that. was the damage bad for his vehicle?
apples are good for you! they were first grown in persia and are now grown in over 60 countries!
what kind of calling card? is it like the old pay phone cards? or an app on your phone?
that would be a neat name for a lawn mower.
yes me too. i use a computer and its internet access to browse the web.
i did when i saw the raccoons knocking over all the trash cans!
yes i do, what about you?
yeah a little bit of those. its a tower defense game.
oh no, i hope they find those workers.
well i think you're in some kind of delirium. i would recommend a vacation.
maybe you can call the polling station and ask them. maybe they can mail you a ballot?
about three or four weeks. i had the fabric in my shop and was ready to go!
it should be within minutes. the number is free too.
i can speak 3 languages. what do you know about me?
i love when they have a bathroom! we need one in our house!
i have to work tomorrow and i'm so sleepy.
oh nice! i wish you luck with both. what kind of restaurant?
congratulations! do you already have a passport to anywhere? or are you excited about this one too?
yes, and then we can talk about the bus driver
oh my goodness, that's really irritating! how long have you had those pimples?
do you know how i can help, mrs. stevens?
i didn't.
nah, not at all. where do you think we should go?
that would be delicious. it would be like getting a big piece of cotton candy
what do you mean step over here?
they let him out because he's a convicted felon.
i love long drives, what did you drive?
really? they weren't when i went! how come you're embarrassed by it?
i'm driving to the grand canyon. i haven't been there since i was five. i am really looking forward to it.
i think you'll be fine. did you make sure to put your correct name on the reservation?
so you are a first time patient to be treated by doctor taylor? what is the treatment plan for you?
that's good, because the battery could be failing or you may have gotten a lemon. did you buy it new?
nice to meet you lisa. tell me about yourself.
maybe you can get a free month of online access and try the job hunter tool.
yes. they believe that he will guide them to heaven.
i think i'll get an icecream cake.
why is your stove out? it's a bit hot in here. are you going to be late?
no, but i love to snorkel in the salt-water.
yes, why not? will you cook for me?
that plus i'm really enjoying the sport.
well, the pigs are very young, and i didn't want them to cry.
i am glad you understand. why are you worried?
oh my goodness, i hate roaches. i'd be furious to see a huge one in my bathroom!!
i am at work. how about you? do you work?
i would be down to go by bus if we could find a cheap place to stay
did her fiance tell her before or after the wedding was canceled?
you owe the fees the school charges you for being a part of the university. are you going to call them?
that sucks. are you able to withdraw it or do you have to wait
awww, that stinks. what was it that you thought you were gonna get?
well hopefully you find it. have you contacted the police?
wow, how good can he be when he is practicing like that?
they're the best group ever. they are all the top 10 best band of all time!
that's very true. it hurts to have hair get ripped out!
oh. that can be done at any of the stores. what kind of member's card are you looking for?
cool. what kind of painting do you like to do?
i can date as soon as you can be civil.
oh. i don't watch a lot of tv. what channel is it on ?
it's been like that for at least the last 8 world cups.
yeah, one has a little lid that the trash cans don't.
that's really cool. i wish i could have been there to witness his acceptance.
ah, that makes sense. i hope she doesn't mind that it's too big.
their appearance mostly. they are so creepy.
yes they are. that's why i always check my shoes before going out
there are amusement parks for people and kids to play in! like roller coasters and the like
you're right. but the way he looked, i thought the mother was going to run up to him and give him a hug. i mean i don't have any kids yet, but i'm sure i'll miss some of those little moments.
i am a barber not a butcher.
i would say michael jordan for me. he is a top five player all time, i don't see anyone coming close to him.
maybe! what do you usually drink?
it's not ridiculous if you think on the big picture.
that's true. they are more educated. but it's worth it in the end. it is a very demanding profession. i'm a nurse so i have been around a lot of doctors.
well, as long as you aren't laying on the phone or table and falling asleep. you should be able to get some sleep.
they sure are. do you enjoy being a cheerleader?
i don't care. anywhere with good food.
i like snow too but not when i have to shovel it. what is your favorite snow?
i really just needed a new pencil.
it would've been better to match the colors of the wall or something.
maybe ask around your family or friends to borrow some money.
what did you have to do that was so irresponsible? it's terrible you had to lose your job over it
i agree, i think it'll be worth it for all the extra money. do you have a job lined up?
david is my son. i'm not your mom.
i have gained 2 pounds. you are lucky.
i know how to do addition but not division. so, you are right.
what kind of search are you having trouble with ? if it's for a job then just start talking to everyone you possibly can.
yeah i know that feeling. i used to play basketball in high school and i'd watch my team all the time too.
i think you are overestimating their love for obama. it was more about hating mccain!
ah! i see that it's a school zone
i work all day from home.
oh no. i hate smoke in my house. do you have any idea how to get rid of it?
oh that's the worst! did you have to buy a new pen?
you should. leftovers are great.
not really, i don't like being scared but planes aren't as scary as flying a car.
you should be going 10 mph over the speed limit.
the check got bounced. you should have cashed it.
yes! i think the bride looks best when she's laughing.
oh no! i hope you still have the check!
have you ever tried peanut butter boiled peanuts?
do you have any other furniture you need to take care of?
no but i do not trust them to give me a reliable computer
that is great, i'm proud of her. she will be able to buy a lot of junk now
i don't either. are you single?
you are right. ice cream has more calories and sugar than other desserts.
thanks. it felt very good to think about those ideas.
they do. they're gonna check us again.
oh, no, that's not good! do you think they'll get a divorce too?
cool! i like warhol art. are you going to frame it?
you could take the 43 from downtown montebello to the downtown area.
so tell me, mr. stevens, what are we looking for?
so what types of biology will you study? like bioinformatics, or genetics?
then that is good. what kind of business are you going to start?
i would move there as well. was it cold?
oh yeah? what kind of italian? what do they specialize in?
cool. did she like it? were you able to take her home
i've been struggling with motivation. how may i help you?
oh ok. did the doctor say anything about it being related to the team or the sport?
it seems to be in good condition, the realtor said. i am very eager to purchase the property
nice, good luck. what kind of engineering?
it's just a small amount but i try my best to give to those who are in need.
you may want to contact the store you purchased it from. that's very odd it didn't make any ink.
i know a great place to find lost muni buses near you!
what was that question ? i'm sure the host is easy to find.
haha i wish. i'm glad i have my dad to live with instead. he's not as good as my siblings but he doesn't make me angry at least.
yes, i have a us passport.
good thing you waited! i've seen people run red lights before.
that sounds like a bad time. why are you cutting yourself?
so why are you worried about the grade you will get then if you're transferring anyway?
wow, did he wake up?
oh no! they don't like how you dress? or are you not interested in dressing in the same way?
well i am not sure what country you are in, but in the u.s. a mortgage is not really that expensive
you mean b as in billion? a b is just a b.
no it wasn't - but you found one.
well, we can always cut it shorter if you want.
he was great. did you enjoy the eight years that he was president?
i am so nervous! will the x-ray reveal anything bad?
i wish i could babysit for you. you seem pretty trustworthy.
that is a good deal. what kind of guns are they?
what changes have he made ?
you should have it by now. you better turn in a pdf.
you should have asked your landlord for a reduction.
you should not because it is not your place to tell her what to do.
it's true! it was a big puddle of water.
well, i guess you could call around and ask if they have anyone that knows how to change oil or something.
that is very nice of her. does she like soup or does she just like to cook?
no, what kind of suspicious did you see?
no, i'm just lonely.
sure. i love to cook.
yes, he does. he even bought me a nice one too. i love him so very much.
i wish i could make it. it is one of my favorite desserts and my favorite food of all time.
no, just the hatha yoga. it is supposed to be relaxing.
he's a ghost. ghosts don't talk.
i've never really been a fan of tigers. is it an important part of your project?
yes! i was gonna say you could do a lot of damage with three cigarettes?!
what kind of card are you looking for? a membership card for a sporting club
i appreciate that you appreciate the vote! it's very important to me!
you can't prove something doesn't exist. i can prove it does
a sandwich, i am hungry. i'd like to go out but there's nothing open and i don't know where the nearest 24hr diner is.
that's too bad. did you try to borrow some?
what's nearby? the ocean? the mountains? the great ocean road? or a city that your family have recently visited?
what's your best price for a 2017 mustang convertible.
yes. send it back.
maybe they want to keep it a secret and are not your friends.
because i do not pay attention to those classes.
oh ok. well most cities have their own transportation systems.
that's crazy talk too. have you told her what's up?
sounds like a good plan to me! i hope you can go somewhere nice.
my dog peed on it, i'm going to change it again
i think you should quit because you don't want to work.
i hate mosquitoes! i have a huge one on my fridge that i hate.
i love baseball too.
oh that's cool. are you going to taste the cake?
what kind of breakfast? is it like a restaurant breakfast or like home cooked? or both?
5 years ago, divorce is not an option anymore.
well it looks like a mess now. you better get on that!
wow. i do not know that. you must be a very proud mother. that is really cool. i'm sure james loves being with you.
did he say why he gave you the recommendation?
nice! i'm going to a concert tonight, so i probably won't be watching much hockey
oh nice! i'm sure you'll find something stylish!
that's a good idea - it's always better to have a snack with you at all times.
no one knows about my account. i'm safe
i have never done that. what kind of furniture was it?
oh, that's annoying. why did you buy the orange one?
no i am not wasting my life! how are you wasting time on a website?
a chicken salad. it's my favorite.
a chicken salad. it's my first time trying them!
i'm sure they aren't. do you ever go swimming in the ocean?
well, it is the age old question: are the artist and the consumer in the same world?
yes, i'll need your drivers lisense
they're like gerbils. they like to spread them.
they are mounted to wall studs. i'm a photographer so it was necessary to be able to access every picture i've captured.
maybe it wasn't so unlucky.
well you see, the super villain from a comic book is a person named villian
no. i am just so lazy and apathetic. why would i be kidding you ?
i would have been terrified to get out of the car! what did they do to you?
no honey, the neighbor has been watering them.
hi, willie foster. do you have a last name?
oh okay. what kind of lunch will you get?
because he's a good player who has been in the league for a long time.
nice! how long have you been voting for him? he has done great things in office
that one is just fine. it's much farther away.
i put a dollar in. i think i'll get you back soon.
well i hope you get the chance to do it again. it is a great way to relax!
nice to meet you lisa! tell me about yourself!
i'm not sure. i haven't been there in over a year. but when i went it seemed pretty much the same.
well i don't smoke cigarettes, but it would be nice to have a more healthy alternative. there is evidence that the tobacco industry contributes to the health risks, especially smoking in cars.
no. i left it in my other apartment.
i'll probably get cremated. but if i have a good reason for it, i might get buried. i don't know. i'm not sure.

i don't like brussel sprouts, are they good with meat?
well, you can call me richard jones. what would you like to chat about, sir?
i guess if you keep them under water they could stay for quite awhile. i guess i would worry about the color changing too much to the point where they start to turn red. you might be better off buying some red or purple ones.
sleeping mostly. just been reading and hanging out.
i am not close to them. how is it with you.
yes, or a surfboard skateboard or a sled. whatever

not really since it's already been above 90 the entire summer.
then you need to pick the science class that you need.
i don't know, i never write recommendations.
well i hope you get the job! do you think you will be ready for the interview?
i see. can you get to the office quickly? is it a big call?
i know that gravity is just our understanding of the force of acceleration that causes everything to fall down
it sounds like you would feel safer with a security cam. have you ever tried one?
yeah, i read the whole thing. what was your report on?

oh, i love spring too! do you like any other weather?
i am dirty but i clean myself.
that's good. we can check it in together at the gate.
james is always in trouble.
the stations are at the bus stations. you can buy a ticket there.
sure! i'll bring some popcorn and we can binge watch netflix
oh, then who is the mayor of the town you're living in?
oh no! i would be livid! did he apologize or make it up? my husband is late more that i would like, but i never have issues apologizing to him.
the best way i find to do that is to use a mechanical pencil.
well thats good. its hard for some people to sleep early
i have an audi, but it doesn't work anymore.
i went out with a girl i met at a club.
because you'll regret it.
a new ipad. i am a huge tech nerd.
i'm so mad. can you give this ticket to the person behind me?
yes, everything just kind of melts away when youre fishing.

i have! i can not wait to wear it out.
that is exciting. i would love to go shopping in a new place
oh wow, i am so sorry! i have never seen anything so unacceptable in my life. i have been on many busses.
are you sure it has to do with typing? or could it be something else?
maybe not. but i will still hear what it is. i am curious!
that is one of the many desserts they serve there!
he thinks it is something wrong with my vocal cords.
you are kidding, yes? you think that you're a genius?
of course. i'll get you a copy of the contract as well. what's your email address?
yes. because the complex is a suite, you can access the laundry
thank you very much! will they consider my recent disability in the unemployment calculation?
i hope you do! what will happen if you don't have the button?
congratulations. i'm sure that you'll be driving it to your favorite restaurant and the place will be so surprised and happy to serve you.
you could always call ahead and ask the librarian if they know of any other places that have the book you want. that would save gas money!
the deposit amount is the amount that is left over after you have spent what you have.
yes and i think they will clean the ice very well.
lol i guess so, i just don't think that people should be watching other people fall though. but if people do then oh well.

oooh. good luck on that. what kind of switch?
yes, there will be a monthly membership fee. the gym will be called the new fitness center.
i'd recommend an ice cream. do you like it sweet or savory?
we haven't either, it's been awhile.
he's following you. you have to run!
no, it's sung in the language of the people who make the music.
contact the bank and ask them to reverse the transaction
oh i hate those early morning classes. is it a science class?
did she? you don't think the groom looked beautiful in his suit? he did a great job!
wow that's a long time. are they going out of business or are you changing roles?
what are they offering? and what are you interested in? if you're in the business school or business administration you should take them!
it's supposed to be a little cooler this weekend.
i can sell you a membership card for your gym. is it for a particular gym?

that's hard for me. i want to get something for my kids.
it is a chicken salad. it takes forever to make.

maybe she is thinking about you. sometimes when people want to see other people they will do so very quietly and not even bother to send a message to say so.
i wonder how much she spent on all those chocolates.
there is such a thing as a "safe" campus. it's a campus where you would feel safe.
we totally should. what would you want to eat at the restaurant?
mostly rock music. it relaxes me.
why? what would the son need it for? why does he need an invitation?
ohhh that's a bummer. i've broken bones before and it's not fun! how are you feeling?
i didn't. do you think you're above average?
well hopefully you can get an a in the class and get back to your plans.
that's creepy. you must have seen me driving home!
i agree they can be, but i have to think that a few dollars every couple of months would be better than losing your hair.
well i don't work so i get in late.
that's true. i'm still in high school but i want to become a cop and i know you must have worked in order to do that.
it helps me feel a bit more confident in my appearance.
i thought all helmets did that? how would the other helmet protect you from the impact of a car?
the city or the state?
yeah, we should take the bus to the nearest carpool.
yes, it is very big, with a lot of books.
oh no! i hope it isn't serious! what did you use to cut yourself?
yes, but they don't go off if there isn't any smoke right?
that is a relief. i know they have been really backed up. but at least it is there now.
i believe that's true, they sing in several languages.
they do and it's not easy to get into. are you doing residency?

thunder is an electromagnetic force that strikes the ground. lightning is the flashier part
texas has some great weather i hear, but the economy isn't too good!

i was so surprised i got them. i thought i would be stuck with only one
well, we can make it sooner then.
does the food in the neighborhood taste good?
well then they might get away with it. the fee is for missing more than 30 mins
oh man that's the worst. are you gonna have to do some digging to get your contacts back?
my girlfriend. it's the middle of the night.
that's pretty low! i didn't know mayors have a lot of responsibilities.
yes. i would also like to borrow yours.
true. and we went to the same highschool.
yes it tastes good! i love rice cakes because they are low in calories.
i can understand that. have you considered a small audiance instead?
from germany. how about you?
wow, what a great person! i will be able to save more money with his plan, but i am worried about the other person's health policies, or lack thereof!
sounds like you need to make a new steak. what kind of steak is it?
amazon, i was surprised they were in stock
i might just make a big batch of steak and freeze a bunch
oh, yes! the bread is good. how are you?
you don't say! did the plane crash? are they replacing the plane now? are you ok?
triathlons are pretty intense! you must be a fit person for sure.
it's a good idea, that's what they do after eating all those crud.
but then i will have to walk into the bathroom.
no, for not paying the ticket! that would be $200.
i am sure john would be very gracious to have that information.
me too! the old place was really depressing.
well there are plenty of jobs that do not require internet access, how come you don't have wifi?
the paper was flying in the wind. so many people were running late!
not until it happens. it happens randomly. you could be there an hour and it could be another 5 minutes away
i will try my best to answer them. what kind of claim are you filing?
i hear ya. i don't like heights either. have you tried a video game?
yes, but there a lot of them in our garden.
i know. i should have started yesterday.
sounds good. i can pay you next week?
yes because it's a long series of bluedog123s that all lead to the same place.
i am so envious of you! i wish i had relatives like that!
by mail with the instructions they sent me. the election has not actually happened yet
good. you can then prove that you wrote it and that you owe them.
i don't see a place for nails to be.
you shouldn't do it because it will be bad for your body.
that's a little much. pitbulls can be great family dogs.
of course it is. why would i lie? it is the law.
i know, it's also a song from january, and a holiday.
sure, go ahead. i can share my water with you.
maybe you can buy him a present for christmas and then a card for his birthday?

yes! i can even get you a free upgrade too to make it worth your while! i'll get it over with as soon as possible. what's your room number?
we always need milk. i'll have to get back to you on that. i know it's important for babies and older kids.
yeah a wii webcam!
oh, ok, what kind of tree?
it sure isn't. they are very comfortable though.
hey there lisa! tell me about yourself
no, sorry. i meant the parking lot fee. the fine is less than the cost of the ticket.
yes it taste very good. rice cake are traditionally a sunday dinner dish
you should look for a job. if you have a job, the bus fare will be less.
then you should get one. they are not that expensive.
snow is awesome. so are you a skier?
good i was worried. what did you get in the mail?
that makes sense. do you always sit there or do you switch it up sometimes?
well, for some reason, i have a thing for redhead girls. my girlfriend is one, so i know i am a bit biased.
i washed my clothes.
you have to find a way to get some airflow. it's too hot for me, i don't go out. i just use the air conditioner.
thanks! that would be nice. what kind of card game is it?
i'm sure you will crush it! it's just an interview! the rest will fall into place.
potatoes are so delicious. i'm glad you made the transition
no it's not at all. i'm so glad my friends are so generous.
throwing them away. it was a party and we didn't need all the leftovers
the bus to where? florence ave is a major street on the west side of the lake.
oh, did they forget it in the parking lot somewhere?
i meant the type of cigarettes but ok.
i am just so sleepy and want sleep.
then don't come to work! you know they have sick days.
i am not. i am just lazy to make plans, especially when my parents don't even live in the same city.
i should but my mom is visiting me.
i'll just eat some bread, i think. it's not like i need to lose weight or anything.
lots of exercise and eating right. thanks!
almost 10 years. how about you? have you decided on what neighborhood to live in?
oh, well that is a problem! i don't like to pay more for my dress than what it is worth.
oh i'll have to try the icecream!
just that my son is gonna be in school! we have been trying for so long!
that too! and all the rooms have a window in them.
because it is cheaper and i can have more shoulders.
i don't know, how do you tell the time when hungry?
they sure do love color. i do too
oh that is too bad. why did he fall asleep?
i am very anxious for that day. what are you voting on?
oh yes and then you're left with styrofoam covered in a liquid.
i like how the people here are so friendly.
sometimes it is. if they are raised in an environment that has no discipline, and if they were never taught right from wrong, it can lead to problems later on.
i bet.. it's pretty windy too
i know right. you don't want to get germs from the carts
what is inconvenient about it?
what do you do for a living, mr. stevens?
awww, i think they would hate most people.
that's because the car is in neutral. if i were in gear, they would be in a line...i guess. it's weird that i never noticed that before.
thats nice of him to invite everyone. i bet he had a lot of fun
oh that sounds exciting, what will you be going to check out at the bookstore?
did marie have any other friends or family there to help her? is her husband still alive?
yes, but you do not get to decide which kind of doctor to be.
i'm glad that you like the new school. what will she be doing there?
i can do that for you. what is the dress for?
well there is a famous comic book villain from the 80s with the name mr. cold wind
that should be exciting. is there a dress code at the restaurant or no?
what was he late for then? i hope it wasn't for work?
amazon. i'm excited to start reading them!
since 2007. do you know which neighborhood you'll be living in yet?
that is not bad advice at all. do you like being a teacher yourself?
i just found him online through my favorite streaming service. he lives in my neighbour hood.
i do not drink and would rather go somewhere with a live band.
the chopsticks can easily puncture the rice because of the way they are shaped.
it is gross. just imagine cream that has gone rancid.
wow i've always wanted to visit italy, have fun!
well that's no fun. do they ever let you spend time with them?
ohh okay. i have a car problem too and it sucks. what did you end up doing?
mail in your ballot. you can do that from anywhere.
yes. i bought her an outfit.
no, but i think the new one will be out tomorrow
it started with a headache, and lasted until i was about to pass out. it was so bad that i could not even walk. but i'll definitely tell you the symptoms that i'm having now. thanks.
the fact that i have to go back and do it all over again.
from the u. s. in the southernmost part of florida. i usually just ask for directions if i'm in a city.
nothing, but i have a hard time keeping secrets.
that's true but it's good that they don't have the germs that are contagious.
oh well, hows about a nice sweet tea?
you should endorse your check. if the bank doesn't, they can be fined
300 new workers or 20000 old workers who have retired? that number is crazy.
wow, six year old car? what's wrong with it?
you should check out a museum with exhibits about historical artifacts.
i'm here for the workshop today. what is that about?
no buckets, only sand.
maybe. what kind of restaurant are we going to?
i think i will like whatever you tell me. i want to know.
they couldn't see what i wrote if they were looking.
i'm taking an uber. do you take the bus often?
that sounds horrible. i hate those kinds of videos. did you watch the one about people falling asleep with their phones?
why would you want to get the tumblr app? are you just curious to see what its all about?
i would never do that. wolves can be so scary.
you're welcome. do you have any other questions about it?
i don't remember his hair.
no. you cannot borrow my notes.
you must be from africa and don't know any african americans.
well that sounds mean. why not dress like them instead? are they too pretentious?
well i guess we can make it more unlucky for you.
thats not a lot! i would recommend looking online for a cheap place to live.
oh no! i don't know which direction to go.
that sounds like fun. what kind of park? nature or city?
it is! it's the perfect dinner. do you like steak?
why do you want to paint your whole house? what kind of paint are you thinking of using? are you painting with a primer?
i'm sure john will love this. it will make him very happy, because his credit card expires in december, so he won't be able to afford it for a while.
i bet it was exciting! i vote every chance i get
well that's a good thing that you're worried.
i know what it means. i just thought it was funny.
it must be popular if it is on every afternoon!
yep, especially those who are not used to driving with that kind of wind.
no. did i touch it with my mouth?
mostly rap and rock. you?
those are great too but i like roasted more.
me neither, i'm not into relationships

what, specifically, did they say you'd get? do you qualify for food stamps?
i bet. i hate laundry
wow, you must be a hard gainer. how long have you been eating this way?
well now would be the perfect time then.
it's been hard to study for those.
you are in good hands as dr. taylor is the top neurosurgeon in the united states
yes, it's a shooter game.
i love coffee too. but you need to slow down with the drinking.
i'm self employed, do you?
that's so nice. i wish my boyfriend were at the market with me.
a few. i am going to have to grab some food real quick. i have to get back to work and i need to eat soon.
i have never gotten a political pamphlet before.
oh wow! i bet it is a very nice whistle.
the beatles and pink floyd are some of my favorites, along with some others.
that is very true! the bed is not a nice color.
do you have any leftover food in the fridge? some frozen pizzas can work!
i bet it took some time. i'm glad you found one.
you're the one who said it looked like a cloud, you do the imagination
i believe it would be called a pass or pass amplifier. it is a little card you use to buy a pass.
that's too bad. what makes it worse each year?
i'm not surprised. you seem really stressed and you need to sleep.
i love to go to this one restaurant nearby!
i have been charged with the robbery. do i have to testify?
psychology seems very interesting. maybe you should look into a minor.
i think they're supposed to be uncomfortable.
that's correct. i only believe in things that i have witnessed
i hope you feel better! why are you cutting yourself?
oh that is cool. i just transferred too.
well, not specifically, but i'm always in a relationship. that's just the nature of being human to want to have someone to share life with.
i wasn't being sarcastic, i honestly do not understand the point of celebrating a purchase like that. it's like someone buying a car, but then never driving it.
cool! so you must love science! why did you choose biology instead of any other field?
yes but the ticket will say "cash for bus ticket" so i would go to the main bus area, they should be able to tell you how to get there. or you can call the bus company, i know they have phone numbers.
i'm sure that i can help you file a claim.
it is with spirit airlines, and it is in terminal 3.
i teach 7th grade math. you a teacher?

i hope you get rid of it! cockroaches are very pesky.
you mean membership to a gym or a membership for a physical activity club?
about 2 weeks. i worked on it every night.
yeah, they do. it's been really stressful!
the check bounced and they had to reissue a new one. it usually happens when the person who writes the check doesnt pay on time, or doesnt pay you back. thats what that sounds like.
i would say you should plan a couple more hours for your flight.
me too! it was really stressful, but it's finally over.
it does. i've never had corned beef.
i wish there was a train to sanfrancisco.
i'm sorry. try the pimple popper app. it'll help. if it's a zit that's coming to a head it will usually be a blackhead.
that is because your dog has chewed it up. it's still a good quality toy!
true, but you can usually get a general sense based on the shape of the toe box.
wow, that is a lot. are you selling any of them?
he sounds like my mother. is your mom rude too?
yes, no problem. we are all certified in all fields of handiwork. so you should not have any problems. i hope you enjoy your new furniture and your new apartment!

color copy? that's not going to happen at the business center.
i don't think i have one, they're all so good

i don't think lemonade would taste good in a sandwich.
wow. that was crazy! i thought they said 40.

that's not a good idea then. you should rest your shoulders
i am taking science classes. my grades in science are great.
we have a volleyball team. our tennis team is not very good.
i don't think i have heard of a silent rave before
yeah you are. the bread is delicious though.

i have seen a dead bug before on a plane. is it poisonous?
i do, i feel confident we will win the afc south this year!
that makes sense. is the movie any good?
i don't make it. i was late to work today and i'm so sorry. i just hate it.
oooh, which one? italian is my favorite food.
you can go online and register
the bus schedule is available online, and they'll have their stop marked on the ground.
maybe you have a friend who has done it before. or youtube videos?
i'm not watching tv right now

thank you, do i have to go to an unemployment office?
i have read the sign, but i'm going to fight it.
no i had a bin nearby.

what did he say? you are right, the son has a very nice speech
i love andy warhol. is this your first time getting it done?
that and also because i want an athletic career.
i wish they had a left-turn arrow for the entire line.

so the police officers did a bad job at their jobs? what did they do that caused you to be wrongfully arrested?
i don't use facebook.

yes, it's an offence, and they will ticket him.
usually they will have a sign on top saying what stop it's at on the bus.
i have never subscribed, but i like the idea of reading about people's lives. it's nice to get their perspective on things, and also to see people who are doing things that i think are worth talking about.
i would say that's pretty easy once you have the basics down. parking can be very difficult for beginners, so just be sure to watch videos online to get an idea of how to properly park. good luck.

yes, i am interested. how long have you done this?
ah. do you think you will be able to get one within your budget if we save?

i've a little freelance writing experience.
what do you think about the name willie foster? is that a name you have ever heard before?
why not invite him yourself? why does his son need your permission to come to your daughter's party?
i wonder what they use on good guys.
i've never even heard of muggers. do you mean a robber?
they must not feel so big then. do you like the tiny ones or not?
was that dinner going to be salad because your hands are really slippery?
what did you do in the meantime? did he come? he usually takes a few minutes.
i have a bunch of picture frames that i use to hold my pictures in an album i have. i also use photo albums to store my old photos.
it's a lot of traffic though. traffic in pasadena is horrid.
oh no! did you get hurt in the car accident?
the waitress had a bad attitude though.
ah, i see, yes i can understand that, it would be quite peaceful. if you can afford it i would suggest going to a luxury hotel, they can really keep you from feeling isolated
oh, well then. what won't you like?
good. don't run the light.
that's a good thing to do. what kind of shoes did you get?
the bride is always beautiful but sometimes the groom is too.

you must be really hot. what kind of sweater will it be?
i believe that the measure 2, and 3 are the ones you are talking about
i'll get the extra gas for you, too.
well maybe someone on the internet will loan you some money.
that's true but she hasn't dated any of them.
wow, that is a lot of veterans.
we're sorry that's happened to you. can you let us know what kind of fees?
i do, i don't understand how they can do it without my consent
that's a term that people use for the weight of the freshmen during freshman year
you deserve it. you're doing a great job as the nominee!
if you're late again, the fee goes up.
sure, i can help you look at it.
oh! is it a sit down restaurant? they have some sit down places that are fast food-like.
it is amazing! i love when the groom and bride have that perfect wedding and everything.
that's great. i would've been so mad if that happened to me. the worst thing is you can't do anything about it, except buy more all day passes.
an old one but still runs good. i just like to drive. you?
you should not drive that slow. you are a hazard to traffic!
hey mr. angela. are you ready for this interview?

it would be so delicious. we should eat one today!
it's so rare to see chocolate cake nowadays. did the dessert last you a long time?
i know. it will be a long month.
it was about 10 years ago now. do you not have any kisses yet?
i did that, but i think i'll get a tattoo.
because i am not sure of the answer. do you think it is correct?
i know right? the kids and grandkids just don't know what we grew up with! i love the variety in everything. we used to go to the shopping mall every weekend when i was a kid.
the sun hurts my eyes, and there isn't anything interesting around
oh, no. i'm sorry. i hope it was a check to cover the whole mortgage and not just some money left over.
i'd suggest cutting back on coffee.
that is always a good option. what kind of sandwich are you making.
yes. we have a lot of people who work here. i hate to be late. i also don't like to be gross when i get home.
well the woods were once the place you belonged as well.
but cats can't fly or bite your face off.
but, mom i am clean.
that is a good plan. we should go to the new restaurant together!
why? because i thank a stranger for their kindness in this world?
yea its pretty hot and the trail looks tough.
so i don't need to do it again for a while?
i think we should return it to where we purchased it .

maybe you can try earplugs. those things reduce noise a lot.
no. i don't like looking at myself.
the storyline is much more interesting than the movies.
oh no. i hope that he didn't hurt you. i would have gotten out and ran too.
that's true, however if i were sick and in bed, i would not want to move to try and breath fresh air, even if it's just for a few minutes.
it doesn't work like that. it bothers the world.
i love the hot dogs.
that is no good. do you have a way to put it inside to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside?
i need you to help me find a summer job for me.
sounds great! i can use the extra money.
sure that's fine. what are we going to do there?
the delivery of the pizza. it's late
oh, i'm sorry to hear that. it's always hard to move out of your home

the same way i always do; with the ballot instructions.

you get to be a teenager. it's great to be carefree.
that sounds like a very fun appointment you have planned there.
yeah, i'm going to try again with another college, though. i just don't think that this one is for me.
ohhhh lol. yeah some people do like big noses.
oh no! i hope you didn't lose too many channels that you like!
yes, but there are some that still have analog transmissions, even though they broadcast in digital.
great. it's a pleasure to help you mr. johnson
so why are you stressing about it then if you're not taking any other class?
oh no! was it in a car wreck? how are you going to pay for a new leg now?
i didn't do anything.
yes, he does. do you like the same bands as him?
well, that would be a problem. can you get it cut?
no, a racing game. it's fun.
oh, i'm jealous! i love appetizers
oh, why not? it's a beautiful city. where'd you go instead?
maybe you should take a look around. it might be in a nearby house.
there are roller coasters, water parks and a variety of things to do
oh my gosh! how exciting for you! i'm going through a divorce myself. it's tough but you'll get through it. congratulations on your upcoming child.
try again later. try not to be frustrated.
yep, i was so into it the first time. i'm not usually into that kind of anime though.
no more homework! that is so great.
sure! as long as it is something that could be done online. what do you need it for?
no, i left my key at work.
oh i hope you find one soon! good luck!
then why did you tell me to go ahead and tell you if you don't want to do it?
i hit something that was white.
you can look at reviews. i like using trip advisor.
you should be able to purchase a ticket on the bus or at a convenient store.
no i've done it so many times that its no big deal anymore.
i've got some jokes but no one to tell them to
whatever you like. but i suggest a cheeseburger with bacon on it. what are your hobbies?
the answer is no longer than 30 seconds. it is a telemarketing call.
it is a farm ville game where you manage your community.
they didn't. they just sent him home with food.
i didn't get out of the driveway though. did you?
nothing! the bank will fix it for you. they will just take out the difference.
i love the attic! you should have some candles there.
i'd like to leave the first day of the month in july
no, he just said that he'd be over.
yea and it would save gas and time.
i think it's because i am so used to you dating a ton of girls.
someone left their car parked in my space so i hit it.
well, you are more than welcome to view the apartment.
i did. they all came out as average.
i work for amazon. it counts.
i do, but you should be more discreet about letting me know that you're about to pull me over.
oh, what question was it? it's a very popular site.
nice, did you have any previous experience as a painter?
4 more, and i have to go to work soon, so it'll be dark soon!
you will have enough if you want it enough.
i don't know if i could wait until saturday. i'd be looking all around for a cake that looked exactly like his.
one is blue, and one is yellow. they all say "trash can" in them
i don't usually go swimming. do you?
oh no. are you in a place that has been affected by those earthquakes?
i guess so. did the person who gave it to you know you liked blue?
oh, i hate pencils that are hard to sharpen.
i'm not aware of any fees for access to the fitness center.
i like to think of myself as an extra tenant.

a goal to play on, a rim to shoot the ball off, and a hoop for the shooting
is it nice to sit in a convertible with the top down?
about a mile. we'll stop in between towns.
that stinks! what will you do now that you're laid off?
well then , i'd recommend the "tour of the art district". it's a beautiful sight to behold.
you are the one who always makes up excuses, not me.
you can't gain weight if you never lose it. so, that isn't a lie.
why not the mayor? i voted for him.
well i am excited about the food.
i have a pomeranian. he loves walks.
sure i can give you a ride on my horse.
it is the biggest riding lawn mower on the market. it's great!
not yet. my mom has to go shopping with my sister, so i'm waiting to see her to get it. i hope she likes it.
that is always disappointing. hopefully more benefits will follow.
spotty is old enough to know better. do you think he wants a pet?
oh, sorry. what do you mean by step over here?

they did, thank you again
a tap card is a credit or debit card, you load it with money.
yeah, i really hope i will pass
no. i think i will get it removed and paint. the tar doesn't really look good. i don't want to pay for it, so i'm just trying to get away with it.
yes, but the world cup is only on once a week in december. the rest of the year it's college football.
maybe you shouldn't sit for so long then.
sure, what do you need help with? they're really just a case of removing the screen protector.
oh, i don't like those kinds of laws.
i've always wanted to but i never do. i don't watch much television anymore since i have kids. they are always on.
she had a really fainting stroke. it is a very serious condition.

i have never cheated on anyone. i wouldn't cheat on my wife
i'm not that interested in baseball.
i hope you find it. what will you do then?
yes, people here are very friendly.
that is true. we could do that, but i think we should get some souvenirs while we're away. it is important to take care of the souls of our friends and neighbors.
well, it's only 2 days, but i understand your worries.
i've never voted for obama. i don't have a problem with obama as president. i just wish the rest of the democratic party would stand up for what's right.
i am not sure i understand. what did my face look like?
i disagree. i consider myself a moderate republican.
ok, so where is the roof? how can i get there?
because i'm afraid of them. they have huge eyes.

of course! god is a good friend. we are all in this together.
i am glad you can fit it all in one suitcase, how long are you staying?
i hope the soup was very sweet for him!

i was worried that my dogs would run away!
yes it's not. especially when they try to charge you for it.
my dad is just a bad person. do you know anyone who has a good divorce?
that's a lot of chips. do you want any salsa with that?
i didn't have any in my apartments when i lived in them.
you must be very anxious about the drive!
well they can't charge you for a minute late, they can only charge you $5.
i am sick and i don't feel like myself.
just life being life. i don't feel like getting out of my comfort zone

sounds cool. i have never used tumblr before
not too often. but when we do the other five don't seem to mind
sure. i'm ready to work.
i don't blame you, i've been there before. i'd suggest getting up earlier or taking a nap.
ugh, that's no good. is the house on fire? or is the power out? either way, you need to call fire department!
it's just close to my place, i love the food.

then you can come to mine and we will take the call together.
i think it's gonna be like 10 bucks.
i've never heard of that before. are you sure it's your computer's fault?
a steakhouse salad. they take forever.
hi mr jones. whats it been like working with abc?
but you could be a medical assistant. doctors do that too.
i would suggest a script as some over the counter pain relievers can be quite potent.
my girlfriend. she loves flowers.
that's exciting. are you going to a christmas parade or anything like that?
he's right behind you, watch out.
they are probably not bubbles but just small particles of water.

i don't like any of it.
i bought some stuff i really needed.
about 20 minutes. i want to eat
not picking my nose
thanks, i hope it's going to get me somewhere.
that seems insanely high. i would not even be able to put down 20%
i like salad too! but i'm not a good cook so it's hard to make good salads.
yes but ice cream has more fat than other desserts.
because it's a restaurant! you can't expect everything to close at 11.
that's terrible. how can landlords do that!
i take the train to school. i don't understand why you are so angry about this. i guess maybe you feel like you are getting treated unfairly.
mine was a long weekend. did you do anything fun?
do you like being a cheerleader? or you do not know yet?
that could've been bad! it looks like the weather might hold.
yes, but who knows if the school will save money or not?
i am sure you have many bills that you owe in the billing cycle.
arizona would be a good place to visit. what will you do there?

oh, i think it would be cool to get a tattoo of something symbolic
oh wow.. did you pay it? what did the police officer write you for?

oh, me either. what do you smoke?
ok, you'd have to go to the passport office in the usa

i don't like tv.
oh i see. i never use public transportation
i'd rather have a bit of cash and be a house of comfort
yes, you can. just don't make it too personal. if you're asking me a question, it's probably time to think about the answer.
why? there is still time to change your decision if you want to, jonathan.
because i don't like change.
it does! the buildings and the landscape has not changed too much.
i hate chemistry too. are you planning to rectify the mistake?
you're welcome. hopefully we'll find him.
i think the pay will be better, and i'll have a better work environment
so the fruit that humans have invented was amazing? i don't think i understand

what is the reason for getting married?
they are, i don't like my nails to be greasy
i don't know what good is it, but some people feel a certain way and then find some sort of way to cope with it. it is important for us to find that kind of happiness in our lives.
what did you cut yourself with?
he would be happy to get that. what did you tip?
because the carpet isn't cleaned.
i'm sorry to hear that. were you at fault?
yes, because you are out there fishing, not worrying about anything else. it's very zen.

did you ever get a chance to talk to the identity theft people? i hope your account wasn't affected.

you can purchase passes for all different types of buses, such as city buses and regional buses.
oh yeah? what does the big switch involve?
oh no. why would someone do that to another person?

i'll sell for even less. i've got a stack of them sitting around.
i'm a babysitter too! but i don't have any kids to babysit. i just watch them when my mother is on vacation. i really want to be a nurse though.
that's pretty slow. do you feel you are driving safely?

what type of membership? a gym membership or a health insurance subscription? or what?
they said that it was a combination of stress and anxiety.

i love cats and dogs. i hope they get to go home and have a good life!
that's funny. what about purple? is that her favorite color also?
well if i were in the position of being able to choose, i would have them make me some fries with extra salt and ketchup. or maybe some barbecued brisket if i felt like it. but salted potatoes sounds good.
it is, but the game is worth it.
i hope your trip is smooth and your bus fare is less than $ 50!
oh yes there is. it is very important to know where the spots are on campus.

the water is so murky! i don't think swimming is in our DNA.
yeah. it's supposed to reach 85 degrees by noon.

thank you for the quick response and the x-ray. will it hurt?
that is no good! are you out of town and do not have a fridge to store leftovers?

it's still okay but i hate it.
yes i am really excited to hear back from some.
yeah it's going to depend on how many cars we get out ahead. i'm sure they'll be more than a dozen of us. not that that's much.
i am a very organized person. how about you? what is your passion?
we have something for you. you will get paid a bonus, right mr. johnson?
wow that's pretty fast! i've been thinking about getting mine done
i don't like the privacy it requires to post.
oh, that's no fun. how long were you on the plane?
i'm sorry, that's just how you pronounce b
i can imagine its a fantastic sale at that.
that's terrible. what was the husband thinking?
me either. we should find something new.
oh ok, so what makes the spring so great and unique?
i would not let them buy any unless the guns are stored out of the state. there have been cases of gun owners selling their collection to other people.

oh i hope you're prepared to go to a bank or some other form of transaction to withdraw it?
i will get it fixed. what can you do for me?
you should not because you'll get addicted. it's bad for your health.
ah, i see. they're probably quite smart, considering that usc is a pretty good school in la. did they talk about the game, or was it strictly business?
oh, i'm sorry! is she ok?
oh no. is it that hard to get all of your contacts together again?
i was able to read it. what was the report about?
oh no. what a terrible way to end a job. did you find a new job?
i'm not sure. the bus should not take that long!
no, what was the report on?
that depends, are you cute and do you have a dog?
well that is a lot less time on duties than i thought! maybe he should spend more time on them.
i speak 4. what languages do you speak?
i bet. do you have to take it on the road with you?
that's always an awesome perk. what sort of breakfast is it?
ah, you mean the school is offering courses for summer.
that is true. but it is also true that you cannot lose.
i don't trust people.
i was using it to call my sister. she thinks it's disrespectful to do that
like a job, my kids, my car.
of course not. i just find it very late to be getting ready.
maybe i'll wear my seatbelt. how are they dangerous?
it's like a chore!
that's understandable. have any luggage storage places nearby?
i'd love to! what is it that you need help with?
i think that's why he hasn't crashed yet.
for my wife. she likes flowers.
i didn't! that's so interesting, i love chocolate. i bet you could also make it into a dip for veggies, like celery or carrots.
it would be sad if they didn't. how else would the city stay in business?
oh wow that's a long time. did something happen that made the company dislike you?
oh i hope the stove is working okay.
you sound very excited about it, what kind of purse is it?
well, it's a good first passport! do they give you a new photo at the border?
that's cool. what kind of cake was it?
what kind of cake? i would probably get him some ice cream.
mrs. jones is always trouble. always.
yes i paid my phone bills. they had been cutting my lines since 2016.
i can understand why! you were the worst worker there.
i am sure that this bike will be great for the triathlon!
she likes scarves? what about some new shoes?
that should be a simple process, since the money is still in your savings account.
that's crazy! maybe you can just take it really easy until then?
i don't go camping because i'm afraid of the dark.
no, just a regular traveler.
you're not going to break up with me are you, i need you to say it before the night is out.
you can't prove it, but you can observe it and feel it.
i want to teach. english is such an important language.
school is very very hard. i hate it.
he has money and wants to spend it on something else.
they are also artists too. just like us artists
thats terrible. did you not do the homework?
you must be pretty anxious about getting that furniture. what kind did you order?
oh no! did you put down new carpet? or is he just too little to clean it up?
i don't like free food. it's usually garbage.
because the fish is the only pets i need to sustain myself.
i feel like the dirty part should have been a big clue.
oh, that's great! how many kids do you have? do they like it too?
but that would mean i can't listen to it.
why would you want to wash it, it's a cool piece.
yes! it's so inspiring and i think i might try it! i like that they use a variety of different actors in the commercials too.
i could go to a store nearby and ask for some water.
that's not cool, sarah.
i leave at 12 and it is a domestic flight.
that shouldn't stop you. you can find plenty of jobs online.
you're welcome. it's not your fault.
why do you think it will be embarassing? just try really hard and you'll be good in no time!
i am just good at doing the addition.
i'm a claims adjuster! what questions are you having, george?
i don't like to watch other ppl play video games.
there are personal and corporate accounts. personal requires no minimum balance or minimum balance requirements.
ah, i understand. i hate when classes start so early.
no i checked and everything is there.
why am i wasting my life?
oh yes you can. i am a girl.
do you have neck pain often? i hope you don't get any more.
i think it looks great! the neighborhood seems very quiet as well.

that is too bad. are there any other ways you can contribute to the ticket costs?
there are plenty of schools in the usa in safe areas.
lol i did, the ac unit installed itself.
she just said because i have school.
what were the conditions? he didn't even give me a chance to counter or counter his offer?
what are you thinking about asking? i'll try my best to answer them.
it looks like it might be green now. watch out!
oh yeah? so what ideas are we talking? what is it you liked about it?
why would i? officer. did you read my mind?
that's too bad. why is your life so stresfull?
that is horrible. i can't imagine how she must feel. it sounds like she had a beautiful wedding. did they explain the reason why they didn't come or just say it was cancelled?
oh ok. how do i hold the knife then?
you can always use google services to search for jobs without internet!
i will try and watch it. are you a fan of either team?
what sort of things do you plan to put on the tv ads? how will you be funding them? i'd like to help.
it depends of who is around. sometimes they talk about work!
on the beach right now. how are you, roger?
yes, as i am the property owner. why would you not have access?
oh cool. maybe you should open a savings account too
oh no! is it because of the heat? have you been to the doctor recently?
that's true. she even introduced me to a lot of them
what did i do? i don't know.
i think it would taste like a cotton candy stick.
oh, i'm sorry. do you know where i can find a parking spot?
that is cool. so you get a discount on the calling card.
thunder makes a loud sound, which causes lightning to strike
i guess. i think i'd be more upset if i were the one that fell though. at least with celebrity deaths, they are often a celebrity who did something that makes you want to be better! with death, it can just be sad.
that's good. cleaner the better to keep it running smoothly.
apples are high in vitamin C. that's why i like to eat them!
i agree i hate traffic. how long have you been living there?
it's against the law to not pay for parking as well?
you should. it is very important to your health. don't skip out on snacks!
oh no. have you tried giving it some water? what does the mother do?
you can't have a point if you don't know what the purpose of living is.
i'm a professional runner. it's my job.
nice to meet you lisa. tell me something about yourself.
i love chocolate cake. what's your favorite dessert?
it's cool, but it can mess up your car if you don't know how to drive in it
not if there aren't any more seats available. you'll have to wait for another bus.
do you have any idea why you might have a fever?
i've been working on some music i am writing.
yes they do! they have a motion sensor to keep people inside and the back door has a deadbolt.
that's awesome! did your favorite artist have a lot of new tracks or just remakes of the older records?
i hope the changes go over well. what changes did he make?
that's a relief! is it a long hike?
how long have you been a painter?
i love you more now.
i know a few people that can do artistic stuff. what is your artistic style?
that's so awesome. congrats. i don't have a house yet but i can't wait to buy one.
oh exciting, what is the big announcement? a promotion? new job?
uh oh. what kind of steak is it? i love me some medium rare steaks
oh, i hope it was a lot cheaper than a new computer
i'll probably get cremated because it is cheaper.
i've never seen it. i'm scared of zombies.
i'd love to move there too. where were you?
yes there are. some require a social security number to open up.
oh. do you want to watch something?
oh, good luck on your interview.
me either. unless the leftovers are from the night before.
that sounds expensive. are they at least fixing the brakes for free?
you can use your fingers also. just be careful with the chopsticks!
do you know what science class you can take? or are you just kind of winging it?
they have over 600 songs. it is amazing. do you like any other band?
i'd say the bus that goes directly to campus.
i have a nice sofa, it is a recliner with arm rests and a built in comfy arm rest.
that's a good idea anyway. i don't trust anyone enough to even leave my wallet in there, let alone my car at night.
it depends on the language but opera can also be done in english and french.
that's good. at least you can see who cashed it.
that's nice of you. i'll miss you too
you need to change your name to michael roberts.
it'll be ready for you when you get back. it's going to smell funny though.
oh i always have to make sure i can see. that's always been my problem.
yes, he did. the apartment was very clean.
it was, i was happy to get that dessert!
because it's a good thing for society.
that's still considered late. the fine is $55.
wow, what kind of job did you have and what exactly did you do that was irresponsible?
it is never easy, but worth it in the end i'm sure :)
i voted for the mayor last time around, but i didn't vote for this one either.
yeah! you have to be really careful about those red ones! they're super dangerous!
yes, i'm trying to keep up with my teammates.
yes. you will buy the ticket from the driver.
do you think the ones on 3, and 4 will improve them?
we decorate for every holiday but the christmas one is our favorite, we have the most fun with it!
okay, which claim? i can help you with that.
i love coffee too! but too much of it, even if it is a little bit, can effect your blood sugar levels and cause you to get headaches.
i'm trying to get him to take his health more seriously. he wants the gym so badly.
i'm looking for someone to spend my life with.
that's terrible. what's even worse is that it was a bank site.
i'm sure you can teach me some card games.
yes that sounds great! we can go and have some unhealthy dessert after.
is it going to hurt the tree? are you trying to remove it entirely?
i'd like to get the latest information on how to take care of my pet gecko.
ugh! i am sorry. that is such a lot of weight to gain in a month.
good luck! what sort of race is it?
oh yeah, always. have to do that on the highway!
i don't think they'll like your drawings.
i think they're cleaning the ice and the rink surface.
me too. i've been very happy with my new place.
it's actually an open world survival crafting game. what genre is shooting games?
i know a few who listen, but don't care for most of it.
mom, i am not dirty!
i see. i love traffic. what about it turns you off?
oh, no. was it a nice pen?
yep. i was glad my husband was with me. he knows better than to mess with puddles
i am divorced and so is my partner.
that is fun to do. do you play baseball or just run
i just want to know why you're afraid of me!
he won by putting the birdie from 185 feet into the rough on the tee box
good luck! i hope you find it soon.
oh i love dollar store shopping. is that your favorite?
because it will only lead to problems.
well done! now it will go green. have a nice trip!
no problem. i'll keep a lookout too.
oh no. are you going to take precautionary measures to avoid getting another fever?
that is good, my neighbors were loud all the time.
i'm guessing you are using a phone right? try it using a computer.
how is that a waste of time? it's my life not yours.
yes! she uses fried rice, so i like to eat it.
and i appreciate you as my president for life.
oh god. that's terrible. do you have any way of tracking him? i'm pretty bad with roaches, so i know they can be quite hard to find.
yes but i still like going there for the free bread.
i have no idea. i've never heard of weather being important to the news!
buried. i don't like the idea of being cremated, personally
good. you should charge it to 98 percent and let it sit over night
oh that makes sense, i'm not a fan of frozen food either.
how was your day after you were robbed? did you feel violated or ashamed?
oh, okay. are you going to fail or get a c?
well of course! i am always cleaning my nails before i eat anything! how else would i know if they were clean?
yes, that and the fact that some parent are not good.
you can vote by mail.
i've heard some air conditioners work by blowing cold air on your skin to make you cool
thank you. here is your license and registration.
wow, nice. did he give a good speech on why he loves his father?
he's a poodle. he has to be walked daily.
maybe they're just a different kind of cotton candy, like strawberry or blue raspberry
well you mustn't have done your work! i'm sure you'll find a job somewhere else soon.
yes he is ok and he is breathing.
oh no. did it make you feel bad to wake up late again?
good luck, hope you get the interview. maybe you can get a hotel or something.
what kind of claim? i might be able to answer them.
pizza sounds nice. i like all kinds.
i'm hoping so. i have been searching for the perfect job and school for years.
oh wow that's crazy! did your state vote by mail or something? how could it be any other way?
i would recommend target because they have some cute and stylish clothes that they have in a variety of sizes and shapes.
the basic checking account doesn't have any fees for transferring money in and out of your bank.
oh ok. do you watch all the other players? do you get jealous of them aswell?
i'm waiting on the chicken salad.
i would hope so. they're chips after all!
nice! i love the park. do you think you're going to be alone or with a friend?
well it is a good thing you don't! apples have sharp, pointy ends!
what kind of fruit?
i usually just donate blood at the blood center.
i think we're too. what else have you been doing?
i work long hours, and i just don't enjoy the work. i'd rather spend the time at home just relaxing at home.
nice to meet you bill. what will you be doing for your next vacation?
maybe you could take the key to a locksmith and see if it is the wrong key.
do you have any leads on a summer job? i'm in dire need.
something that will give him purpose in life. he is destined to have everything
that is awesome!! sounds very relaxing. did you have a good time at the buffet?
sounds good. any particular sights you'd like to look at today?
yes, they can take their belongings. we are very nice with them.
ah, that could explain it. are you going to sleep soon?
i can't imagine how they can love obama while not liking obama-care.
oh, that stinks. are you in pain or is it just aching?
i'm so sorry, how did they get in?
they have to clean them. they have a lot more germs than you think.
i think it might be easier to tell them apart if i saw them on the street.
what about an asian market? you can find rice at a lot of those.
2 more hours. it's going to be a gorgeous day.
oh, i'm glad to hear it. i don't know how i feel about the doc helping the player though.
i was just following the car next to me, officer.
i try to be picky but sometimes i failed
i'm pretty sure i can find it. i've been on so many muni busses in my life. it's a pretty common thing to ask for. is the stop near you or far away?
a good job, good house and good family.
i arrive at the airport at 11 o'clock.
then turn off the lights. you can turn the lights off and on again by pushing a button.
well, you should be more worried. you need to talk to someone!
that's a good guess. what else could have possibly happened?
well it's a little boring to only eat that.
well, you should really get it checked out. it's not good at all if it hurts like that.
o wow. where are you from? i've never heard of a bus
that's because my wheels have the right width for my bike.
no. i don't see waiters often.
sure. i've ridden the bus in toronto for years. just look up "boston bus ticket". i bet it's right there.
in less than a minute. the new one is going to start in about 30.
are you serious? or are you being ironic? i'm not sure.
i'm pretty sure the company is watching us.
awesome! my family is going to be there too. do they like football?
oh, well, tell the truth, why you won't
i have no idea what math class you're taking.
well then you are in luck! it is available for viewing.
and it's raining dogs too. lol
how did you get a ticket? it sure isn't like they are enforcing it now.
i can see why that's inconvenient. it's not like we can talk to you on here anyway and i don't know what else you're up to.
thats good. it shows you actually wrote the check and it cleared.
no i have no clue why you would have pulled me over.
it helps you to know what kind of person you're dealing with.
my father gave it to me when i was in high school.
that is the stupidest thing to report since someone died in a sock in the dryer.
true that. i wish more people planted flowers.
i like all kinds of cake, even fruit ones. did you have any other desserts?
that's not good. is he able to go to the hospital?
i've never gotten a pamphlet from the town council.
cool, i have a few suitcases as well.
i am a bad waitress though.
i wonder if the postage stamps would have been so cheap if they were still a penny.
i am disappointed in myself for what i do
no, they cut the wireless without me knowing.
that's not good, especially on a friday. i hope you get to your computer soon.
well you're wrong. sour cream is delicious and you should try some!
i'll have a seat. do i know you?
yeah dresses are pretty expensive. did you try on any others?
oh i hate people who do that. do you like to live with him?
it is a club for golf. a golf club is typically made from a hard rubber or plastic with some sort of stiff metal handle. that isn't one of them.
just act casual. you're too smart to care.
no. i am waiting till the class starts.
well, it is for my wife, so i am not sure. i don't want to get something that she'd hate and i get something she'll love.
oh wow, so did you have to sit in the aisle? i'm afraid of flying, so i would've freaked out.
well since its my birthday i can date any day.
so does everyone. so what color are you're eyes?
maybe you should try to find out. it could be something you ate.
5th grade. i also teach math and science.
that's awesome, what kind of pitching?
you are right. do you like it here in green shirt?
yes, they are. but i'm not sure how popular i would feel being a cheerleader in high school. it's kind of a weird time in someone's life.
yep, she dated a lot of people.
cool. so what are some fun facts about biology?
boiled peanuts are very nice. they are also made from legumes.
because they are more like myths than anything. we have no proof they even exist.
of course i don't mind. it will be quick.
good, it will make you look so much happier when its all cleaned up
i can pay for it for you! do you have cash or credit to go with the ticket?
well you better get internet access so you can apply for jobs online.
that is true but your odds are so low that it is not worth the risk.
i would say it's important to know how to parallel park.
are you scared? i've taken the bus many times.
how could they see my account information?
oh no! why would you be sick? maybe you should drink some water.
sometimes, but sometimes i'm just on vacation, and the plane is full. and when i am on vacation i am a little more comfortable with the seatmates.
you mean invite the kid's friend to your daughter's party right?
oh, i was just running around throwing snowballs!
i know how to fix cars and do a little gardening.
the fee that you owe the college for having your tuition paid for through them!
maybe you can find a neutral color. the bright colors make me feel like it's a party!
we also have a basic savings account for people to use if they have little money.
it doesn't sting my eyes! i am so scared. that is why i'm glad he was shot.
i'm not much of drinker. are you?
yeah, they do. are you going to go into medicine?
the host was a co-worker of mine
picking his nose. he's going to get sick.
that might be acceptable. what is the table made from, is it soft or hard?
sure, what kind of favor would that be?
i've felt the same way in my last job.
that's great! have you also visited any other museums, like the national museum of freedom?
i meant an american bank account. are you american?
wow, i guess they just never went off in my apartment.
ok. then just take the free shuttle from the hotel to the city. the tour will take you to the most famous sights like the riverwalk. i will be in the room with you.
to prove to himself that he can do anything.
oh no! did anyone else notice or is this going to look bad on your resume?
oh! but isn't the pay a million times better as a doctor?
that's cool! how many kids do you babysit for most days?
oh no, what were you preparing for? you can always come inside to get medical help.
you can always do more laundry. you don't want to look like a slob.
i have work. do you go to work while camping?
it would probably be easier to go to medical school instead of continuing with biology.
yep they have locks on them as well as the exterior door
yes, i could give you a ride.
maybe 10 minutes. we don't have a car.
it still looks the same, but there were more people then. now it has a lot of tourists
i was born in chicago but am currently studying in new york
cool, where in budapest? how old is he?
sure, why not? what time should we go out?
there is no "the greatest" only great players.
i'd love to go to hawaii. have you been before?
vending machine is better than paying for a soda
yes, we go over often to catch up.
that's a good reason to break the law! not like we're going anywhere.
i put in five, you have to pay back.
it's not free, but it is a gift.
but my profile picture has to be of me.
we have a swim team, but no tennis.
you can try to clean them with a magic eraser. it's good for removing stains and scuffs!
it's a wonder. i know the drivers are responsible for all car related activities, but i don't think i could drive like that without being terrified.
nice! have a great first day! do they have all the programs available for you?
sure! you can ask me anything about me and my opinion on anything.
thats not too bad at all! was it your first tattoo?
cool! did you like being a painter or did you have to go to work everyday?
ok. so are you trying to win office? or is this just an extra fund raising event?
i bet they were, that place was the scummiest place i ever experienced
oh, well public transportation is very much a luxury in the us. but if you can, it might be worthwhile! i don't know much about it.
ohh, i hope they'll have a healthy baby!
but why is the speed of the internet slow? is it the connection to the internet or the computer you are using?
yeah that's fine. what will you say if i call your room?
no, it's more of an adventure game. i got the new assassins creed.
nice to meet you lisa. how long have you lived there?
ok so he can have it next week. how many people are you having at your party?
nope, it's a racing game, which is strange since there aren't many good racing games these days.
well that is silly. you do not have to dress in the same way to be friends.
i see! i have only experienced one earthquake!
i do. its a great feeling to get a job.
i think because swimming can damage our bodies. it is a very bad sport
because it seems like such a small step. they're already in a good position.
oh no! they must've been right though, the hard drive was probably the issue.
nah. i just watched ep01
oh no! are you okay? is it still healing or did it scar?
you could try cooking an egg in a bowl with ice cream on it! i bet that would be tasty!
is it the nets and wizards tonight? i love basketball! do you like any other team?
oh cool. i love italy, what's the first thing you're gonna do there?
that's awesome. it's always a relief to get a new passport
i think you mean stereotypic, lol.
call your bank and tell them what happened
wow, that is a lot. what do the new workers do?
everything. they communicate in a variety of ways.
it's located a couple of blocks from where i work.
but i'm not listening to it at all.
i hope you stop doing it soon.
it must have been a pretty good recommendation. did you like it?
the old movies were very interesting in many regards.
that's true, but the school will lose the money!
oh wow, that's a long drive.
the beach. we could swim in the ocean.
no, there are many colors in soccer balls.
oh no! i would be so upset. did you have to pay for another flight?
well that's pretty cool. are you going to have to drive out there for the interview?
i was trying to show off my pork shoulders
oh. that's not very specific! what kind of sweater did you want?
you don't need internet to do that, we can help you
it's where college students go to write their personal statements.
because they can hear you from so far away. it just makes me uneasy.
well, i will probably not like it either. but tell me anyways.
oh that sucks, you are working overtime or just more hours in general?
what other flags are you referring too?
did you call recon before applying? that usually helps to speed things up
well, you can if someone else already parked here.
ah, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope it doesn't hurt your feelings too much to hear, but you're not obligated to stay any longer, even if you don't like your new neighbors.
oh well you should just give it to me and i'll help you get it in that size.
yes, it is! get out! your room is the only room!
i'm not an installer. how do you install it?
that's what i say when i buy two identical cars lol
congratulations. that's really awesome and makes me feel really good for your new home.
the neighborhood looks great, it's very clean.
over 10 years. what do you plan on doing here? are you looking for anything in particular?
it is, but worth it. there are many things you can do with it. you can use it for business and personal, and it can even be used to make a digital image that is stored on hard drives.
i'll just do something else while you pay.
great, we have a good bond. how about yours?
yes i've worn it and i'm really happy with what i purchased
well that is good. it is a hard class.
it might be a mistake. you should send it back.
i've heard it comes from the cheese plant.
i'd be calling and complain. what fees are you getting hit with?
a free breakfast for a job well done! that's great. my husband has been working in a hospital for years so they give him free breakfast there as well. you are blessed.
nice! we'll get you started on this new car right away. now, let me tell you a little bit about our lord and savior, elon musk.
oh no, it is out the front.
she is shaking and sweating a lot. she is calling an ambulance
do you have a favorite place to get a good steak?
i thought they were going out for cigarettes!
oh. well i'll try anyways.
i'm not a fan of baseball. what about you?
i know. i hate swimming!
me too. do you play or just watch it?
that's pretty funny. did you at least enjoy the food afterwards?
oh nice! it will be great for the triathlon.
my car was parked on the street and someone drove into it.
one of my favorites is pink floyd. i have a lot of favorite bands though, some of them are not american.
i'm a subscriber too, even though i haven't actually visited any of the locations they feature. i love the pictures of food.
that's sad that it wasn't what you expected. what will be the difference in benefits?
just chicken. they don't serve the house salads in the dining halls so i had to get it from another place.
and some people think it's just, well, going on.
the guy i was seeing. it went very well!
so not by hand then? do you use some special type of brush?
i'll feed him. he's hungry!
but you don't know if people you're chatting with are your actual age.
i understand that feeling. did obama disappoint you this time?
it's not dinner yet. still cooking.
oh, i am confused. what are his conditions?
yes, we are going to see the museum of natural history, which i've heard is amazing! but the bus is much easier. have you taken the bus before?
i've had those shifts before. i hope you are at least off at 2am so that you can sleep well.
just that you never did before. i'm guessing it went pretty well though.
no, i'll stay up all night listening to my favorite music!
that should give you plenty of time to get to the airport. you will be fine.
that is nice of them. do they ever have time to be alone with us?
i love it when it's chilly.
i understand, but we are not his parents.
it's a new bus service that's supposed to be on time. it must be the weather!
i don't use social networks. what is it for?
no, i don't like swimming in the salt water!
well i hope you can get your absentee ballot in before election day.
that's not that special, i got an a too
i don't have a car currently. do you own a car?
you should practice using them then. you could even get a chopstick set.
i hope you like it. what kind of food does it have?
usually there is a board with the stop number on it.
it is always a fun experience getting a new id! my second passport had a lot of stickers!
yeah i don't like the flavor of it either. i think it's a chemical they add to it. i like drinking lemonade better.
really? i have only seen it once.
oh no. was marie a good sport about it?
the world cup has been going on for two weeks now. how many days in a row has it been?
he will come soon enough.
anything you'd think of to get me. anything.
oh yeah that is pretty high. i like to go slow
that's a good idea. you should also drink more water.
we need everything that you can provide. just fill in the application.
i'm a clean freak. it's been a long time since the last time i cleaned it.
i am sorry, but maybe its time to face up to the fact that you have been hiding it and tell her. i mean the alternative you are doing is to lie, and that is no way to start a marriage.
i am ok with it. i can apply to other schools.
no, i am on the road with no water.
that does not sound very good. are you going to get a new one or do you plan to fix this one?
yes that's true. but it would really help you keep your hair healthy.
wow that's cool. i like cakes, it's my favorite dessert.
oh no. you should've just went to the bank to sign it.
oh no. are you going to have surgery to repair it?
yes. i scored very high on the iq test.
a rim and a net. the hoop is optional if you don't like contact.
that's not surprising. fruit in general can be hit or miss.
