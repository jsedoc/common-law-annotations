Having 3/4th of your land surrounded by a\ncoastline means that fish have found their way into almost every cuisine in\nIndia, and there definitely isn\u2019t a dearth on the variety of seafood dishes on\noffer. Bombay, boasting quite the coastline itself, is home to many a seafood\nrestaurant \u2013 but where can you find the best meals? Well, that\u2019s where we come\nin. To please the seafood aficionados, Homegrown has picked out some of the\nbest restaurants that offer rather delightful seafood meals. Make sure you\nread this post lunch.\nI. Trishna\nGo here for: Manglorean seafood\nThough it\u2019s a tough place to locate, nothing can stop Trishna from being\npacked at mealtime. Their juicy Butter Garlic Crab is probably the dish that\nkeeps the loyalty flowing and is unlike anything you\u2019re likely to taste in the\ncity. The prawns koliwada, butter garlic squids, tandoori fish and rawas\nhyderabadi are also more than satisfactory.

Tea has\na stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.[6]\nTea plants are native to East Asia and probably originated in the borderlands\nof southwestern China and north Burma.[7][8][9] An early credible record of\ntea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua\nTuo.[10] It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang\ndynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese\npriests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.[11]\nDuring the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English,\nwho started to plant tea on a large scale in India.\nThe term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis.

For the Cantonese tradition of drinking tea,\nsee Yum cha.\nCulture of tea\nA Japanese woman performs a tea ceremony\nTea culture is defined by the way tea is made and consumed, by the way the\npeople interact with tea, and by the aesthetics surrounding tea drinking.\nTea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at\nsocial events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for\nthese events. East Asian tea ceremonies, with their roots in the Chinese tea\nculture, differ among East Asian countries, such as the Japanese or Korean\nvariants. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the\nbeverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small\nprivate gatherings (tea parties) or in public (tea houses designed for social\ninteraction).\nAfternoon tea is a British custom with widespread appeal.

Chinese teas can be traced back all the\nway to the Tang Dynasty and were first discovered in 2737 BCE, by the Chinese\nEmperor Shen Nong.\nIn the Chinese culture, tea is considered of the seven necessities of life.\nThere are five basic categories of teas in China; white, green, oolong, black\nand post-fermented (Puerh). Chinese tea is almost as recognizable as Kung Fu\nis in the Chinese culture. Tea is actually drunk more frequently for healthy\nliving than it is for thirst.\n### Different types of Chinese Tea\nWhite Tea \\- White is made from steeping the dried immature leaves of the\nCamilla Sinensis Tea Bush.

The difference is in how the tea is\nprocessed.\nThe process of oxidation is what creates green, dark, or oolong teas.\nGreen tea is produced from fresh tea leaves that have not undergone oxidation,\na chemical reaction that begins when the leaves are exposed to the air and\nwhich is responsible for the color and taste of different types of tea. Black\ntea is created when leaves are fully crushed to enhance oxidation, and oolong\nis created when leaves are wilted in the sun and slightly bruised to create\npartial oxidation (1, 2, 3).\n> Summary\n>\n>", "7 Potential benefits of drinking Chinese tea | St George & Sutherland Shire Leader | St George, NSW  _0 | Skip to navigationSkip to contentSkip to footer\nMenu\n## Recommended\n### News\n* Local News\n* Court and Crime\n* Politics\n* Property\n* Health\n* Education\n* Investigations\n* National\n* World\n* Bushfires\n### Sport\n* Local Sport\n* National Sport\n### What's On\n* Things to do\n* Food and Drink\n* Theatre and Arts\n* Gigs\n* TV Guide\n* Movies\n### Community\n* Your News\n* So You're Holding An Event\n* Babies, Weddings & Obituaries\n* Newsletters\n* History\n* Send Us Your News\n* Sponsorships\n* Schools\n### Comment\n* Your Say\n* Opinion\n* Send a Letter to the Editor\n### Digital Print Edition\n### Life & Style\n* Life\n* Travel\n* Recipes\n* Books\n* Fun Stuff\n* Celebrity\n* Shopping\n* Christmas\n### Jobs\n### Classifieds\n* Place a Job Ad\n* Place an Ad\n* Tributes\n* Celebrations\n* Cars\n* Real Estate\n* Ag and Rural\n### Recommended\n* Features\n* Special Publications\n* Partner Content\n### Listen\nSearch Site\n* Home\n* Home\n* News\n* Sport\n* What's On\n* Community\n* Comment\n* Digital Print Edition\n* Life & Style\n* Jobs\n* Classifieds\n* Recommended\n* Listen\n* All\n## RecommendedPartner Content\nList subcategories\n* Features\n* Special Publications\n* Partner Content\n1.

Cooking techniques and ingredients vary\nwidely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to\nbaking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions.\nTypes of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks.\nCooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional\ncooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.\nPreparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have\nstarted around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for the\nsame does not predate more than 1 million years.[1]\nThe expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between\ncivilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New\ninventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and\nboiling of water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply\nadvanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the\nflavor of the dish served.[2]\n## Contents\n* 1 History\n* 2 Ingredients\n* 2.1 Carbohydrates\n* 2.2 Fats\n* 2.3 Proteins\n* 2.4 Water\n* 2.5 Vitamins and minerals\n* 3 Methods\n* 4 Health and safety\n* 4.1 Security while cooking\n* 4.2 Food safety\n* 4.3 Effects on nutritional content of food\n* 4.4 Carcinogens\n*", "Cooking Channel - Recipes, Shows and Cooking Videos from Top Global Chefs : Cooking Channel | Cooking Channel_0 | *   *   *   *   *   *\n* Watch Live\n* Apps\n* Stream on discovery+\n* Log In\n*     * Profile\n* Log Out\n* Register\n* Shows\n* Chefs & Hosts\n* Recipes\n* Videos\n##  Our Favorite Weeknight Dinner Recipes 10 Photos\nGet healthy, delicious meals on the table quickly with these easy staples.\n###  Our Best Recipes\n###  Spaghetti and Turkey Meatballs\n###  Roasted Baby Potatoes with Rosemary and Garlic\n###  Balsamic and Parmesan Roasted Brussels Sprouts\n###  Teriyaki Chicken Thighs\n###  Perry's Turkey Wings\n###  Potato and Leek Soup\n###  Shishito Peppers with Soy-Ginger Sauce\n###  Braised Tri-Tip Roast\n###  Balsamic Glazed Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta\n###  Cory's Famous Mac and Cheese\n###  Cuban-Style Pork Roast\n###  Tomato Sauce with Beef Bone\n###  Chicken Tikka Masala with Fluffy Basmati Rice\n###  Barbecue Ribs\n###  Good Eats Meatloaf\n###  G.

For cannabis intoxication, see Effects of cannabis.\nWhite bread\nAnders Zorn \\- Bread baking (1889)\nBaking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven,\nbut can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked\nitem is bread but many other types of foods are baked.[1] Heat is gradually\ntransferred \"from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center.\nAs heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and\nmore with a firm dry crust and a softer center\".[2] Baking can be combined\nwith grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods\nsimultaneously, or one after the other. Baking is related to barbecuing\nbecause the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.\nBecause of historical social and familial roles, baking has traditionally been\nperformed at home by women for day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and\nrestaurants for local consumption. When production was industrialized, baking\nwas automated by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a\nfundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, especially\nbreads, are a common and important food, both from an economic and cultural\npoint of view. A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a\nbaker. On a related note, a pastry chef is someone who is trained in the art\nof making pastries, desserts, bread and other baked goods.\n## Contents\n* 1 Foods and techniques\n* 2 Baking in ancient times\n* 3 Commercial baking\n*", "Baking chocolate - Wikipedia_0 | # Baking chocolate\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nType of dark chocolate as baking ingredient\nA 200-gram (7.1 oz) bar of dark baking chocolate, with a minimum cocoa content\nof 40%\nSemi-sweet chocolate chips\nBaking chocolate, also referred to as bitter chocolate,[1] cooking\nchocolate[2] and unsweetened chocolate,[3] is a type of dark chocolate that is\nprepared for use as an ingredient in baking.[1]\n## Contents\n* 1 Production\n* 2 Varieties\n* 3 Manufacturers\n* 4 See also\n* 5 References\n* 6 Bibliography\n## Production[edit]\nModern manufactured baking chocolate is typically formed from chocolate liquor\nformed into bars or chocolate chips.[1] Baking chocolate may be of a lower\nquality compared to other types of chocolate, and may have part of the cocoa\nbutter replaced with other fats that do not require tempering.[4] This type of\nbaking chocolate may be easier to handle compared to those that have not had\ntheir cocoa butter content lowered.[4] Lower quality baking chocolate may not\nbe as flavorful compared to higher-quality chocolate, and may have a different\nmouthfeel.[4]\n## Varieties[edit]\nIt is typically prepared in unsweetened,[1] bittersweet,[2] semisweet[5] and\nsweet varieties,[6] depending on the amount of added sugar.\nRecipes that include unsweetened baking chocolate typically use a significant\namount of sugar.[6] Bittersweet baking chocolate must contain 35 percent\nchocolate liquor or higher.[6] Most baking chocolates have at least a 50%\ncocoa content, with the remaining content usually being mostly sugar.[1]\nSweet varieties may be referred to as \"sweet baking chocolate\" or \"sweet\nchocolate\".[7] Sweet baking chocolate contains more sugar than bittersweet[6]\nand semisweet varieties, and semisweet varieties contain more sugar than\nbittersweet varieties.[7] Sweet and semisweet baking chocolate is prepared\nwith a chocolate liquor content between 15 and 35 percent.[6]\nThe table", "Baking mix - Wikipedia_0 | # Baking mix\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nDry foodstuff used in baking\n\"Prepared mix\" redirects here.

Rooster or cock is a term for an\nadult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has\nbeen castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually\nimmature female is called a pullet.\nOriginally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were\nnot kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th\u20132nd centuries BC).[1][2]\nHumans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their\nmeat and eggs) and as pets.\nChickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a\ntotal population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[update],[3] up from more than 19\nbillion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other\nbird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens \u2013 in myth,\nfolklore and religion, and in language and literature.\nGenetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,\nSoutheast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,\nthe Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.

Chicken tractors may also house other kinds of poultry. Most chicken\ntractors are a lightly built A-frame which one person can drag about the yard.\nIt may have wheels on one or both ends to make this easier.\n## Use[edit]\nChicken tractors allow free ranging along with shelter, allowing chickens\nfresh forage such as grass, weeds and bugs (although these will quickly be\nstripped away if the tractor remains in the same place for too long), which\nwidens their diet and lowers their feed needs. Unlike fixed coops, chicken\ntractors do not have floors so there is no need to clean them out. They echo a\nnatural, symbiotic cycle of foraging through which the birds eat down\nvegetation, deposit fertilizing manure, then go on to a new area.\nThe term chicken tractor comes from the chickens performing many functions\nnormally performed using a modern farm tractor: functions like digging and\nweeding the soil in preparation for planting trees or crops or fertilizing and\nweeding to enhance the growth of crops and trees already planted.\nWith chicken tractors flock owners can raise poultry in an extensive\nenvironment wherein the birds have access to fresh air, sunlight, forage and\nexercise, which caged birds in commercial coops do not have.

Flu is caused by infection with a flu\nvirus (influenza viruses).\nFrom what we know, COVID-19 spreads more easily than flu. Efforts to maximize\nthe proportion of people in the United States who are up to date with their\nCOVID-19 vaccines remain critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. More\ninformation is available about COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work.\nCompared to flu, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people.\nCOVID-19 can also take longer before people show symptoms, and people can\nremain contagious for longer periods of time. More information about\ndifferences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections\nbelow.\nYou cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 just by looking at the\nsymptoms alone because they have some of the same symptoms. That's why testing\nis needed to tell what the illness is and to confirm a diagnosis.

Flu is caused by influenza viruses\nonly, whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of different viruses,\nincluding rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal coronaviruses. Seasonal\ncoronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes\nCOVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be\ndifficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. In\ngeneral, flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms are typically more\nintense and begin more abruptly. Colds are usually milder than flu. People\nwith colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose than people who have\nflu. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, such as\npneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. Flu can have serious\nassociated complications.\n### How can you tell the difference between a cold and flu?\nBecause colds and flu share many symptoms, it can be difficult (or even\nimpossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.\nSpecial tests can tell if a person is sick with flu.\n### What are the symptoms of flu versus the symptoms of a cold?\nThe symptoms of flu can include fever", "How Flu Spreads | CDC_0 | Skip directly to site content Skip directly to page options Skip directly to\nA-Z link\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most experts\nthink that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu\ncough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of\npeople who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a\nperson might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it\nand then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.\n### When Flu Spreads\nPeople with flu are most contagious in the first three to four days after\ntheir illness begins.  Most healthy adults may be able to infect others\nbeginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming\nsick. Children and some people with weakened immune systems may  pass the\nvirus for longer than 7 days.\nSymptoms can begin about 2 days (but can range from 1 to 4 days)  after the\nvirus enters the body. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to\nsomeone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick. Some\npeople can be infected with a flu virus but have no symptoms. During this\ntime, those people may still spread the virus", "Understanding Flu Viruses | CDC_0 | Skip directly to site content Skip directly to page options Skip directly to\nA-Z link\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

The\nbiological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by\nproviding a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate\noutcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a\npopulation) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm\nand egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.\nThe two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination.\nSelf-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the\nstigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-\npollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the\nstigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-\npollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same\ntime, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.\nThis pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide\nnectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1]\nSome flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers\ncontain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers\nhave evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors\nfor the transfer of pollen.

Peach\nblossoms (including nectarine), most cherry blossoms, and some almond blossoms\nare usually pink. Plum blossoms, apple blossoms, orange blossoms, some cherry\nblossoms, and most almond blossoms are white.[1]\nBlossoms provide pollen to pollinators such as bees, and initiate cross-\npollination necessary for the trees to reproduce by producing fruit.[2]\n## Contents\n* 1 Herbal use\n* 2 Gallery\n* 3 See also\n* 4 References\n* 5 External links\n## Herbal use[edit]\nOrange blossom\nThe ancient Phoenicians used almond blossoms with honey and urine as a tonic,\nand sprinkled them into stews and gruels to give muscular strength. Crushed\npetals were also used as a poultice on skin spots and mixed with banana oil,\nfor dry skin and sunburn.[3]\nIn herbalism the crab apple was used as treatment for boils, abscesses,\nsplinters, wounds, coughs, colds and a host of other ailments ranging from\nacne to kidney ailments. Many dishes made with apples and apple blossom are of\nmedieval origin. In the spring, monks and physicians would gather the blossoms\nand preserve them in vinegar for drawing poultices and for bee stings and\nother insect bites.[4]\nPlum blossom\nDescending from China and south east Asia, the earliest orange species moved\nwestwards via the trade routes.[5]\nIn 17th century Italy peach blossoms", "List of garden plants - Wikipedia_0 | # List of garden plants\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nWikipedia list article\nThis is a partial list of garden plants, plants that can be cultivated in the\ngarden, listed alphabetically by genus.\nContents:\n* Top\n* 0\u20139\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* W\n* X\n* Y\n* Z\n## A[edit]\n* Abelia\n* Abeliophyllum (white forsythia)\n* Abelmoschus (okra)\n* Abies (fir)\n* Abroma\n* Abromeitiella (obsolete)\n* Abronia (sand verbena)\n* Abrus\n* Abutilon\n* Acacia (wattle)\n* Acaena\n* Acalypha\n* Acanthaceae\n* Acanthodium\n* Acantholimon\n* Acanthopale\n* Acanthophoenix\n* Acanthus\n* Acca\n* Acer (maple)\n* Achariaceae\n* Achillea (yarrow)\n* Achimenantha (hybrid genus)\n* Achimenes\n* Acinos (calamint)\n* Aciphylla\n* Acmena\n* Acoelorrhaphe (saw palm)\n* Acokanthera\n* Aconitum (aconite, monkshood)\n* Acorus\n* Acradenia\n* Acrocomia\n* Actaea (baneberry)\n* Actinidia (kiwifruit)\n* Ada orchid genus\n* Adansonia\n* Adenandra\n* Adenanthos\n* Adenia\n* Adenium\n* Adenocarpus\n* Adenophora\n* Adenostoma\n* Adiantum (maidenhair fern)\n* Adlumia\n* Adonis\n* Adromischus\n* Aechmea\n* Aegopodium\n* Aeonium\n* Aerangis (an orchid genus)\n* Aerides (an orchid genus)\n* Aeschynanthus\n* Aesculus\n* Aethionema\n* Afgekia\n* Agapanthus\n* Agapetes\n* Agastache\n* Agathis\n* Agathosma\n* Agave\n* Ageratum\n* Aglaia\n* Aglaomorpha\n* Aglaonema\n* Agonis\n* Agrimonia\n* Agrostemma (corn cockle)\n* Agrostis\n* Aichryson\n* Ailanthus (tree of heaven, etc.)\n* Aiphanes\n* Aira (hair grass)\n* Ajania\n* Ajuga (bugleweed)\n* Akebia\n* Alangium\n* Alberta\n* Albizia (silk tree)\n* Albuca\n* Alcea (hollyhock)\n* Alchemilla\n* Aldrovanda\n* Aleurites\n* Aliceara (hybrid genus)\n* Alisma (water plantain)\n* Alkanna\n* Allagoptera\n* Allamanda\n* Allium (onion)\n* Allocasuarina\n* Allosyncarpia\n* Alloxylon\n* Alluaudia\n* Alnus (alder)\n* Alocasia\n* Aloe\n* Aloinopsis\n* Alonsoa\n* Alopecurus (foxtail grass)\n* Aloysia\n* Alphitonia\n* Alpinia (ginger lily)\n* Alsobia\n* Alstonia\n* Alstroemeria\n* Alternanthera\n* Althaea\n* Alyogyne\n* Alyssum\n* Alyxia\n* Amaranthus\n* Amarcrinum (hybrid genus)\n* Amarygia (hybrid genus)\n* Amaryllis\n* Amberboa\n* Amelanchier\n* Amesiella\n* Amherstia\n* Amicia\n* Ammi\n* Ammobium\n* Amorpha\n* Amorphophallus\n* Ampelopsis\n* Amsonia\n* Anacampseros\n* Anacardium\n* Anacyclus\n* Anagallis (pimpernel)\n* Ananas (pineapple)\n* Anaphalis\n* Anchusa\n* Andersonia\n*", "ABC model of flower development - Wikipedia_0 | # ABC model of flower development\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nModel for genetics of flower development\n\"ABC model\" redirects here. For the model of attitudes used in psychology, see\nAttitude (psychology).\nABC model of flower development guided by three groups of homeotic genes.\nThe ABC model of flower development is a scientific model of the process by\nwhich flowering plants produce a pattern of gene expression in meristems that\nleads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards sexual reproduction, a\nflower. There are three physiological developments that must occur in order\nfor this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity\ninto a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly,\nthe transformation of the apical meristem's function from a vegetative\nmeristem into a floral meristem or inflorescence; and finally the growth of\nthe flower's individual organs. The latter phase has been modelled using the\nABC model, which aims to describe the biological basis of the process from the\nperspective of molecular and developmental genetics.\nAn external stimulus is required in order to trigger the differentiation of\nthe meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell\ndivision in the apical meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia\nare formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a\ndevelopmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as\nopposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types\nof meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is\nthe verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem\nelongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium."], "search_queries": "flowers", "memories": ["partner's persona: I have a wife.

Here\u2019s what goes into it.\n* Courtney Mudge\n* June 10, 2013\n* Pinterest\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\nCourtney Mudge is the Organic Certification Manager for Whole Foods Market.\nShe's a 5th generation Texan who grew up on a ranch in the Hill Country. When\nshe's not coaching our stores on organic integrity, she's being crafty and\nsearching for the perfect taco.When you hear the word \u201corganic\u201d what do you\nthink of? If you\u2019re at all familiar with organic farming, then you probably\nknow that a certified organic apple has to be grown according to certain\nstandards \u2013 such as no toxic persistent pesticides. Makes sense. You might\nalso know that certified organic beef comes from cows that eat certified\norganic feed and steer clear (no pun intended) of antibiotics and added growth\nhormones. All that makes sense too. So, when someone says \u201corganic,\u201d bucolic\nimages of farms, orchards and pastures probably come to mind. Bustling urban\ngrocery stores? Not so much.\nWell, like those apples and that beef, Whole Foods Market\u00ae stores are\ncertified organic. \u201cWait, what?\u201d \u2013 you may ask \u2013 \u201cA grocery store can be\ncertified organic?\u201d Yes, it can and we are.\nThough, I admit it\u2019s a little confusing, especially since not ALL the products\nin our stores are organic.

With time it becomes imbued with the\natmosphere of their home, and that is why it is so helpful during first\nimportant events in any child\u2019s life, like kindergarten integration for\nexample.\nAll of it comes with no age restriction.

Dial-up connections use modems to decode audio\nsignals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from\nthe latter two devices to send to another modem.\n## Contents\n* 1 History\n* 2 Modems\n* 3 Availability\n* 4 Replacement by broadband\n* 5 Performance\n* 5.1 Using compression to exceed 56k\n* 5.1.1 Compression by the ISP\n* 6 Usage in other devices\n* 7 See also\n* 8 References\n## History[edit]\nIn 1979, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, graduates of Duke University, created an\nearly predecessor to dial-up Internet access called the USENET. The USENET was\na UNIX based system that used a dial-up connection to transfer data through\ntelephone modems.[1] Dial-up Internet has been around since the 1980s via\npublic providers such as NSFNET-linked universities. The BBC established\nInternet access via Brunel University in the United Kingdom in 1989.[2] Dial-\nup was first offered commercially in 1992 by Pipex in the United Kingdom and\nSprint in the United States.[3][4] After the introduction of commercial\nbroadband in the late 1990s,[5] dial-up Internet access became less popular in\nthe mid-2000s. It is still used where other forms are not available or where\nthe cost is too high, as in some rural or remote areas.[6][7]\n## Modems[edit]\nBecause there was no technology to allow different carrier signals on a\ntelephone", "What is Dial-up?_0 | Skip to Main Content\nSearch\n* Help\n* Tips\n* Dictionary\n* History\n* Forums\n* Contact\n1.

To make the dial-\nup connection, the modem must connect to an active phone line that is not in\nuse. When connecting, the modem picks up the phone and dials a number that's\nattached to another computer.

From the 1990s alternative rock\nbegan to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form\nof grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.[8] Further fusion subgenres have since\nemerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history.\nContents\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* W\n* X\n* Y\n* Z\n## A[edit]\n* Acid rock\n* Afro-punk\n* Afro rock\n* Alternative country\n* Alternative dance\n* Alternative", "Rock music (disambiguation) - Wikipedia_0 | # Rock music (disambiguation)\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nRock music is a form of popular music that normally includes the electric\nguitar, bass guitar and drums.\nRock music may also refer to:\n* Rock Music (album), a 2003 album by the Superjesus\n* \"Rock Music\" (song), a song by Pixies on the 1990 album Bossanova\n* Rock Music: A Tribute to Weezer, a 2002 album by various artists\n## See also[edit]\n* Rock (disambiguation)\nTopics referred to by the same term\nThis disambiguation page lists articles associated with the title Rock music.\nIf an internal link led you here, you may wish to change the link to point\ndirectly to the intended article.\nRetrieved from\n\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rock_music_(disambiguation)&oldid=1062154114\"\nCategories:\n* Disambiguation pages\nHidden categories:\n* Disambiguation pages with short descriptions\n* Short description is different from Wikidata\n* All article disambiguation pages\n* All disambiguation pages\n## Navigation menu\n###  Personal tools\n* Not logged in\n* Talk\n* Contributions\n* Create account\n* Log in\n###  Namespaces\n* Article\n* Talk\n###  Variants expanded collapsed\n###  Views\n* Read\n* Edit\n* View history\n###  More expanded collapsed\n###  Search\n###  Navigation\n* Main page\n* Contents\n* Current events\n* Random article\n* About Wikipedia\n* Contact us\n* Donate\n###  Contribute\n* Help\n* Learn to edit\n* Community portal\n* Recent changes\n* Upload file\n###  Tools\n* What links here\n* Related changes\n* Upload file\n* Special pages\n* Permanent link\n* Page information\n* Cite this page\n* Wikidata item\n###  Print/export\n* Download as PDF\n* Printable version\n###  Languages\nAdd links\n* This page was last edited on 26 December 2021, at 17:27 (UTC).\n* Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License; additional terms may apply.

Most of the bands in\nSarajevo at the time were influenced by heavy metal pioneers such as Led\nZeppelin, Queen, and Deep Purple. Punk music in Sarajevo was also influenced\nby major punk bands of the time, such as the Sex Pistols. Influenced by Bob\nDylan, Kemal Monteno helped popularize folk rock. Goran Bregovi\u0107 was a\nrenowned songwriter and brought his band, Bijelo Dugme, to popular acclaim\nacross Central Europe. Psychedelic rock was taken control of by the pioneers\nof Bosnian rock Indexi.\nPunk rock entered Bosnia from Slovenia, and it set roots in Sarajevo, Tuzla,\nZenica, Biha\u0107, Mostar and Banja Luka. Rock music was most dominant in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina out of all the states in Yugoslavia. Bijelo Dugme was probably\nthe most legendary and influential band of the Balkans.\nDuring the late 1990s and the early 2000s many new bands have formed.

(January 2022) (Learn how and when to remove\nthis template message)\nA music box (American English) or musical box (British English) is an\nautomatic musical instrument in a box that produces musical notes by using a\nset of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc to pluck the tuned teeth\n(or lamellae) of a steel comb. The earliest known mechanical musical\ninstruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In Flanders, in the early 13th\ncentury, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which\nthen hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known today as a\n\"music box\" developed from musical snuff boxes of the 18th century and were\noriginally called carillons \u00e0 musique (French for \"chimes of music\").

This\nalters the flavor, texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent\nspoilage, extend its storage life, and makes it easier to digest. After\nmilling (hulling), the rice is polished, resulting in a seed with a bright,\nwhite, shiny appearance.\nThe milling and polishing processes both remove nutrients. An unbalanced diet\nbased on unenriched white rice leaves many people vulnerable to the\nneurological disease beriberi, due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin\nB1).[1] White rice is often enriched with some of the nutrients stripped from\nit during its processing.[2] Enrichment of white rice with B1, B3, and iron is\nrequired by law in the United States when distributed by government programs\nto schools, nonprofits, or foreign countries.[3][4] As with all natural foods,\nthe precise nutritional composition of rice varies slightly depending on the\nvariety, soil conditions, environmental conditions and types of fertilizers.\nAdopted over brown rice in the second half of the 19th century because it was\nfavored by traders, white rice has led to a beriberi epidemic in Asia.[5][6]\nAt various times, starting in the 19th century, brown rice and other grains\nsuch as wild rice have been advocated as healthier alternatives.[7][8] The\nbran in brown rice contains significant dietary fiber and the germ contains\nmany vitamins and minerals.[9]\nTypically, 100 grams of uncooked rice produces around 240 to 260 grams of\ncooked grains, the difference in weight being due to absorbed cooking water.\n## Contents\n* 1 Milling rice\n*", "Weight loss story: \u201cI stopped eating white rice, maida and oily foods, lost 20 kilos\u201d  | The Times of India\t\t\t_0 | Back to Top\n### Select a City\nClose\nYour current city: Mumbai(Mumbai)\nsearchclose\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* W\n* Y\n* Z\n* Ahmedabad\n* Hyderabad\n* Bengluru\n* Chandigarh\n* Kolkata\n* Mumbai\n* Chennai\n* Pune\n* Delhi NCR\nAll Bombay Times print stories are available on\n\u00d7\nPowered by Delhi Times, Aurangabad Times, Maharashtra Times\n+\nmore\n* Nashik Times\n* Aurangabad Times\n* Badlapur Times\nYou can change your city from here.\nWe serve personalized stories based on the selected city\nOK\nHello,\n* Edit Profile\n* My Times\n* Logout\nSign Infacebooktwitter\nGo toTOI\nThe Times of India\n* Etimes\n* BriefsMoviesTVBigg BossWeb SeriesLifestylePageantsVisual StoriesMusicEventsVideosParentingTheatrePhotosGaming\n*   * Lifestyle\n* Relationships\n* #### Relationships\nLove & SexWorkPetsSoul CurryAsk The ExpertVideos\n* Top 7 personalities that switched their careers and found success\nFeng Shui tips to get rid of BLOCKED ENERGY for a positive personal life\nRanked: These zodiac signs lead a DOUBLE LIFE\n9 things all Bengali parents expect from their daughters-in-law\nLove Capsule: My wife likes to see me use the toilet\n5 masturbation positions for WOMEN that will amaze you\n* Health & Fitness\n* Fashion\n* #### Fashion\nCeleb StyleStyle GuideBuzzDesignersShowsLuxuryVideosDesigners Directory\n* Designer Thierry Mugler's most iconic and provocative designs\n'Shyam Singha Roy' actress Sai Pallavi nails the crop top-skirt look\nFashion Industry loses one more gem- Thierry Mugler\nHere's what you should keep in mind while buying a Banarasi sari\nAnniversary special: Unseen pictures from Varun Dhawan-Natasha Dalal's stylish\nwedding\nPerfect styling tips for grooms of 2022\n* Parenting\n* #### Parenting\nGetting PregnantPregnancyFirst YearToddler and BeyondTeenMomentsAsk the\nExpertVideos\n* The most understanding parent-child zodiac combination REVEALED!\nMental health activities you can do with your kids\nFive chores to assign to your preschooler to foster initiative\nPictures of Anushka Sharma's baby Vamika", "Nutrition check: Is brown rice actually healthier than white rice? | Lifestyle News,The Indian Express_0 | * EnglishEnglish\n* \u00e0\u00ae\u00a4\u00e0\u00ae\u00ae\u00e0\u00ae\u00bf\u00e0\u00ae\u00b4\u00e0\u00af\ufffdTamil\n* \u00e0\u00a6\u00ac\u00e0\u00a6\u00be\u00e0\u00a6\u201a\u00e0\u00a6\u00b2\u00e0\u00a6\u00beBangla\n* \u00e0\u00b4\u00ae\u00e0\u00b4\u00b2\u00e0\u00b4\u00af\u00e0\u00b4\u00be\u00e0\u00b4\u00b3\u00e0\u00b4\u201aMalayalam\n* \u00e0\u00a4\u00b9\u00e0\u00a4\u00bf\u00e0\u00a4\u201a\u00e0\u00a4\u00a6\u00e0\u00a5\u20acHindi\n* \u00e0\u00a4\u00ae\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4 \u00e0\u00a5\u20acMarathi\nFollow Us:\nTuesday, January 25, 2022\n* Home\n* India\n* World\n* Cities\n* Opinion\n* Sports\n* Entertainment\n* Lifestyle\n* Premium\n* Videos\n* Explained\n* Audio\n* SubscribeEpaper\n* Sign In\nSearch for:\nBreaking News\n* Explained: Spread in the community\n* Secularism: Why Nehru dropped and Indira inserted the S-word in the Constitution\n* In Rajasthan village, with some official help: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m first Dalit groom to ride mare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n* C.

Plenty of\ngood things are associated with travel, but there\u2019s one particular issue that\ncan make traveling annoying: the spelling. Travel is easy enough to spell and\nnot at all confusing, but \u201ctraveling,\u201d \u201ctraveler,\u201d \u201ctraveled\u201d? These words are\na common cause of confusion because some people spell them with one L while\nothers use two.\nTraveling or travelling depends on where is your audience. Traveling is the\npreferred spelling in the U.S. Travelling is the preferred spelling in the UK\nor in the Commonwealth. This American-British spelling difference carries for\nother forms: traveled or travelled and traveler or traveller.\nHere\u2019s a tip: Want to make sure your writing always looks great? Grammarly can\nsave you from misspellings, grammatical and punctuation mistakes, and other\nwriting issues on all your favorite websites.\nTo clarify, if you look through books or magazines for examples, you\u2019ll see\nthat both spellings are used, but the two-L version tends to be used in\npublications that also use spellings like \u201ccolour\u201d or \u201cflavour.\u201d Those\npublications are written in British English, while the ones that use shorter\nspellings\u2014\u201ctraveled,\u201d \u201cflavor,\u201d and \u201ccolor\u201d\u2014are written in American English.\nSo the difference between \u201ctraveling\u201d and \u201ctravelling\u201d is really a variation\nof dialect. Both spellings are correct. Or, more precisely, neither one of\nthem is wrong.\n## Traveling vs. Travelling\nThe word travel has more than one syllable\u2014it\u2019s a multisyllabic word.

The term\n\"travel\" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means\n'work'.[2] According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of\nthe word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes\nfrom Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor,\nstrive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work\nstrenuously, toil).\nIn English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means\nstruggle.

It is the primary hardstone of Chinese sculpture. Although deep and\nbright green jadeite is better known in Europe, for most of China's history,\njade has come in a variety of colors and white \"mutton-fat\" nephrite was the\nmost highly praised and prized. Native sources in Henan and along the Yangtze\nwere exploited since prehistoric times and have largely been exhausted; most\nChinese jade today is extracted from the northwestern province of Xinjiang.\nJade was prized for its hardness, durability, magical qualities, and\nbeauty.[1] In particular, its subtle, translucent colors and protective\nqualities[1] caused it to become associated with Chinese conceptions of the\nsoul and immortality.[2] With gold, it was considered to be a symbol of\nheaven.[3] The most prominent early use was the crafting of the Six Ritual\nJades, found since the 3rd-millennium BC Liangzhu culture:[4] the bi, the\ncong, the huang, the hu, the gui, and the zhang.[5] Since the meanings of\nthese shapes were not mentioned prior to the eastern Zhou dynasty, by the time\nof the composition of the Rites of Zhou, they were thought to represent the\nsky, the earth, and the four directions.[6] By the Han dynasty, the royal\nfamily and prominent lords were buried entirely ensheathed in jade burial\nsuits sewn in gold thread, on the idea that it would preserve the body and the\nsouls attached to it.

Illustrated with works featured in Important Chinese Art from the\nJunkunc Collection on 18 March in New York\nWhen starting a collection of any sort, it's important to figure out what\nkinds of works you're drawn to, a consideration that's exponentially more\nvital when it comes to Chinese jades. Spanning millennia, the material comes\nin many colours and has been shaped into many forms. 'It seems basic, but\nChinese jades vary so much in both material and form,' says Vicki Paloympis, a\nspecialist in Christie's Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art department.\n'Learning about them is a journey.'\n>   * 1\n>   * Decide on what you\u2019re drawn towards\n>\nA rare miniature yellow jade archaistic faceted jar and cover, fanghu.\nQianlong period or earlier. 3 3/8 in.

Offered in Important Chinese Art from the Junkunc Collection\non 18 March at Christie's New York\nNeolithic jades, which date from about 2000 to 4000 B.C., typically consist of\ntools, such as axe blades, or ritual objects. These objects are interesting\nfrom an archaeological perspective, because the ritual functions of many are\nunknown and no documentation exists. In contrast, Ming dynasty jades\n(1368-1644) are often carved from different coloured stones and exhibit a soft\nhigh polish, while Qing dynasty (1644-1911) examples, which some people argue\nare the highest-quality carvings, are often found in white, translucent\nstones, and sometimes, in coloured stones.\n'Someone who likes a yellow jade vessel dating to the Qing dynasty, possibly\neven earlier,' says Paloympis of the above vessel, 'might not be", "Understanding Jade and its Importance in China_0 | * Home\n* About\n* History\n* Coat of Arms\n* Staff\n* Officers and Council\n* Partners\n* Find us\n* Work at Gem-A\n* Press Releases\n* GemIntro\n* Education\n* Membership\n* Membership Types\n* Membership Resources\n*       *       *       *       *       *     * FGA & DGA Register\n* The Journal of Gemmology\n* Archive\n* Editorial Staff\n* Submissions\n* Sample Articles\n* Gems & Jewellery\n* Archive\n* Editorial Staff\n* Submissions\n* Media Pack 2021\n* Gem Hub\n*     *     *     *     *   * Events\n* All Events\n* Field Trips\n* Conference 2021\n* Shop\n*   * Log in\n*   * Home\n* Gem Hub\n* Around the World\n* Understanding Jade and its Importance in China\nWed Nov 20\n# Understanding Jade and its Importance in China\nOne of the oldest loved gems in the world, jade has long been revered by gem\nlovers internationally, but nowhere more so than in China.

The term is extremely broad, covering\nThai rock, dance music, rap and western-influenced popular music in general,\nthough normally excluding the folk and rock-influenced phleng phuea chiwit.\nThe origins of string lie in American R&B, surf-rock artists like The Ventures\nand Dick Dale, Exotica, rockabilly and country and western brought to Thailand\nby American and Australian soldiers serving in Vietnam in the late 1950s and\nearly 1960s. It also drew heavily on genres from the British Invasion,\nincluding rock and roll, garage rock and Hollywood film soundtracks. Since the\n1980s, it has mixed with other genres, such as disco, funk and dance.\nIn the early 2000s a phenomenon described as T-Wind, bring forth Thai Pop\nMusic to the international stage, and in 2016, BNK48, a Thai subset of 48Group\nwas formed.

It\nis often based on the premise that pop music is especially formulaic,\nunchanging, and easy to compose. The idea of automating pop music composition\nis related to many ideas in algorithmic music, Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nand computational creativity.\n## Contents\n* 1 Overview: automation in music\n* 2 Automatic accompaniment\n* 3 Melody generation\n* 4 Lyric composition\n* 5 Software\n* 5.1 More or less free\n* 5.2 Commercial\n* 6 See also\n* 7 References\n## Overview: automation in music[edit]\nAlgorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to\ncompose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in\ncounterpoint, for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy.\nNow the term is usually reserved, however, for the use of formal procedures to\nmake music without human intervention.\nClassical music automation software exists that generates music in the style\nof Mozart and Bach and jazz. Most notably, David Cope[1] has written a\nsoftware system called \"Experiments in Musical Intelligence\" (or \"EMI\") that\nis capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human\ncomposer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's\noutput is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is\nhuman-generated to a high level of competence.\nCreativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and\nthe cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about\ntime, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and\nplanning ahead for what might be played"], "search_queries": "pop music", "memories": ["partner's persona: I like pop music.
