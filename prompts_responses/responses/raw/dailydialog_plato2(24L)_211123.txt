yeah i do , but i haven't read it . I'm a big fan of Nietzsche and his works , and he was a pretty big influence on me . I think i should start it soon .
I think I'll be taking the Porsche . I'm a bit more interested in the car itself .
I don't want help , just to know why I have the problem .
I'll have a few pints and a few shots and a glass of wine , good evening !
i have the same kind of dreams but with a different tea set

The toilet is on top of the bed . That's where my cat is sleeping . ;)

If you want the entire thread to be a discussion on how to bring back this subject , I think you're in the wrong place .
I'm going to bed at this time tomorrow .
I know , I'm just asking why the strike is for taxi drivers .
I don't understand your question . Is your question whether the raise will be more than what we're already being paid ? Or whether we'll get a raise ?
she keeps asking . I keep saying I'm not her sister . that's the problem .
i will check , but i doubt the medium will work well for you .
yes . i have you tagged as pompous . my name is kaylee , i will be the only one in the room though .

she is 9 , she likes to do some sketching and she's really good at it .
it's really good . i'm just not a huge fan of the baked chicken . it tastes too salty .
The GIF of the guy saying " Gary ! ! " made me laugh so much for some reason .
you said in another comment that you have no idea where the break was , so there could be a breakin .
It was the only way I could afford to keep it . I'm not a cheater .
then send them in europe . it'll take longer than 3 minutes . you are going to be in line .
it was great actually . i've always wanted to go to new york , so it was fun .
i don't know what influenza means but my tummy is swollen and stuffy . what does that mean ?
nice . how many times have you had to use the sheet ? what did you think of it ?
I have only seen her at school , I have yet to see her in a public setting . I will do that tomorrow .

i don't know what it would cost . but you will have an easy and fun time . get some good food .
ok i'm ready and waiting , i have lots of vegetables , can you give me a few ?
Yeah I can . Do you just want to trade back or does it matter ? I'm online now .

you are the only thing that can make me sleep and make me happy . what can you do for me ?
" Hello , sir , I'm the one who wants to help you . " - Axl Rose
nothing . I guess the fact I've been looking at you and asking you about it ...
oh , you should eat the carp and mushrooms . they can be used to make a stew .
Buy yourself some flowers . They will help .
You're awesome . Can you also put a map of the downtown area in a map viewer ?
A couple of things . First , they are building new facilities , and second , the energy consumption is reduced .
Hopefully just a couple month . I don't know where else to move that's worthwhile .
I'll take them . I'm sure there will be some worshipers of these apples .
i am willing to teach you how to speak english but you would have to be a tutor

You can't borrow the bike , you have to pay for it !

you're welcome . I hope you get a lot more out of that promotion as well .
because if the insurance company wants to be a competetive insurance company they will make a huge amount of money if it covers all the risks .

they didnt . madrid was better . that means barça shouldve won ...

i will be there with my friends , but it is a good suggestion to take a look at the waterfalls
Have you tried calling the cable company ?
i know . but i was wondering about alternatives for a wireless connection , which you don't have . I mean , i could just get a cable to my computer , but i'd be using wired , so it won't be that big of a deal .
well , it's good to know we've managed to keep it a small world for quite a while now .
yes . it helps us communicate better in our work environments . also , they get to know our personalities .
i don't know , it looks like the bus has stopped but we're still in it so i guess we got off early

oh , i am not sure i can go that early , thank you for your time .
can you help me with a payment questions ?
i dont have the i d but i have the cash for you ! i will go to the bank to make an account

Because then you have a bunch of leftover food that is wasted when you throw it out and then have to make more food .
i just needed the bus and was going to go get some chips . i am very intelligent .
turtles and anti-particles aren't the same thing . you could call them a turtlene or a pulverizer .
I've been able to drink two or three cups in that time !
so if I'm going to get a new phone , it would be better if it had Dial Up ?
i'm used , the people here are pretty cool
that's what you get for not buying cockroaches . i would have given you some .
Hey I am sorry I can't give you the bedroom for tonight , but I can let you change rooms . I will be available tomorrow .
It's located in downtown Chicago . We have a lot of fitness centers around here , including one at the University of Chicago
i am not sure how to make an offer . i think i would have to look at other offers in my area and see if they match or if they are even worth looking at . I don't know how to even begin to start negotiating a price .
well i wanted to drink something and now i'm parched . so nothing .
I've never taken an exam on belts . Where did you study ?
No its not a class for interviews at all . Its to prepare yourself and get a feel for interviewing in college .
well , i'm pretty sure she is not going to let me eat anything but fried chicken and water . :(
Hi bill , yes I did , I found you to be an interesting and informative individual . Thanks for the opportunity . I think we can all agree that your company is one of the best in the business .
yes , and i do use the military time . how do I do this ?
I do let it down , its just a wig .
Nice ! It'll be fun to see the final results from everyone's responses here .
i think you've misunderstood me , i'm saying that the luggage is a 10 - pound over the limit
so i should not even consider that i might be working a little bit longer than the contract says ? :/
i was thinking the same . the outside looks like it would be nice to just be in , but inside it looks like a dud
n't . it's not like i have anything better to do . but i don't mind .
I have to go to work , it's time for work
i think its on time , but when its not , its always delayed . i hate having to sit in an alley for 5 to 10 minutes and just be waiting for the train when the train has already left .
but you can give me your deposits . it doesn't matter if it's a small amount or a large amount right .
no , he's a little sick . you can send me a photo if you want .

Then the ticket is for parking in a handicapped spot , it's a common occurrence
it has a few different meals . and they have a cafeteria food truck . that's it ..
i don ; t parallel park . i park straight ...
i dont want to wait , i just need it installed . I am in the city . i can do that .
sorry , I can't really , you have to look for it on an exchange that supports currents .
I suggest reading up on the company you're applying to and see how things have played out in the past . You want to prepare your interviews because that's what will determine whether or not you'll get an offer .
i dont remember , i think i was parking in a red zone when i got the ticket .
I can't stand being on the bus with you , but the bus is pretty chill .
What kind of music box ?
I'm going to a bank now just in case .

I don't think that is a cigar , I think it's a tobacco cigar
I didn't say you cheated , I'm just saying that you did
i haven't seen that one , i have seen a few , but i have to admit i have never seen it . i am not a fan of the biopic films , i think they just take too much time away from the original story .
good to hear . hope everything is going well with you . i'm here for you .
I don't think the Macy's parking lot is the best location , but it's close .
My meal was not served with my approval . 😉
anne , i'm here to welcome you , mrwhite . it's great to see all you !
i am from china but i live in the US so i have little say in what china does .
The roof is leaking because you didn't pay the rent for the roof .
You'll still find plenty of places where people aren't polluting as much . You just have to be willing to move to a place where a lot more people are .
yeah . that's why i'm asking if i can get any discounts . i want all of them !
oh no , i just wanted to see how you felt about me getting the wallet ! you can take it or leave it .
so , if i speed up , do i get to drive around you ?
I like dumplings . I've never tried Mongolian . What would you suggest ?

Hi Dave Thomson , I ’ m Jim
We have flex time and it's a nightmare .
Okay , thank you . I'm going to go to the post office and send an e-mail .
I'm not sure , but I think I'll need to be in the living room to confirm , as I can't see any other way .
I'm looking at the home and there is no open house listed for the house .
Just make sure to be happy when you have your own kid too .
I like it ! I have a similar one . I'm writing an autobiography , called a " Future of China " .
What ? You spread it back home to get a better idea ?
I think it was just bad service . The food was pretty good .
The charity performances are on Saturday , Saturday evening
I don't think that's a good idea to do for every company you work for . I worked for a company that had to do this at one point , but it was not because of some unwillingness to provide the equipment , but because of a lack of budget .
I don't see how hollering back would get him to calm down . I'm already calm .
You can always ask to use your old HDD . They will be able to check if it's a faulty hard drive or not .
Well I guess the more people the better , I'm down .
I need your friend code , so I can add you and be ready to check your egg .
If you're going to act like the seals lost in the last two days then that just proves how much you hate your hometown team , and the sport
I agree . The food was good , just not as good as I was expecting .
I have been a strange cat this morning .
I think I would still be angry that I lended him money . Sorry about your situation :(
Not OP , but I believe it is a calcite , which is a stone .
I'm in . Can you please tell me how the change rooms are set up ? :)
I'll wrap the receipt for you in the plastic bag . You can't take anything from me .
No , but you can send your room number to your friend on a cheque .
Yes , I'm currently in the process of applying to a Press / Site Specialist position
So it's a two week induction with a week to prep . Is that right ?
I know how to read Chinese better .
I thought they were pretty awesome together , I thought Edgar Wright was a good choice . He had that same look about him when he was in The Martian , I think the movie really did him justice .
There's lots of jobs you can pick up with little training and lots of money . What kind of operator ?
I'm not sure what you mean , but it's called " Courts of Law " by David Cameron
So the price is now higher than the price of today's sale ? ! ?
It's a picture of a woman and the text says " good morning " .
I don't have a passbook . I have a picture of your passbook with your name on it .
Thanks ! Sorry , it just looked like a really random room . I'm very glad to see that people were able to recover . Good luck !
I'm ready . Gates are open and you can follow me to my town .
How does one get extra amenities ? I'm a girl , but my question was not directed to you
It can be helpful for me . I've been yelling at people for years .
That's the thing , there's no rush on this highway . It's just a straight road .
Try Uniqlo's V-neck sweater in white !
Thanks , anyway . That's a shame because he's my favorite .
Yes . You may get them by the end of the day or even the weekend .
I might , actually . I don't really like the movies much but I might do that after I finish my paper .
Yes , you may
It's not a special offer . There's an open box sale going on .
Well , then , I can't come .
Hi Tony . I have been called , yes . And Lilly is in the room .
I am , indeed , Mr . Liu . You have made my day .
Jill is not the babysitter . Go get a real one
I'm not stalking you , but that doesn't stop me from being stalked :(
So , it's basically a tax deductible account ?
I don't recall what episode , but Bob has a few more times . The other boss doesn't .
Great , let's drop in on the corner , where there's no one to be seen .
And because people have different opinions on what " successful " is . I personally like a lot of fashion brands but I have no interest in buying any of their stuff , nor do I really care for the style , so there you go .
He spoke with the mind of a teenager . Young men don't know what a good time is .
Yes , and the interior of that house looks beautiful . I really need to make a house that looks good on the inside of my current one .
Not really . I'd like to go to Australia .
I'll come with you ! I've got tickets for tonight . You'll be my last .
You need to have a holiday with me !
Yes I came to pickup my passport , but I was not in this flight .
You will be asked if you are interested in the clothes before you have them washed . I assume you don't know the answer .
It's worth a shot , I know some insurance companies do cover some people with low incomes . Just check .
You're going to want to start with Visual Studio
Hi Jung Min , I'm Bri
I'm very much interested in this proposal and hope that the contracts will not be a problem to work through . Good luck .
I'm not the one pulling out , my car is going straight , you were driving straight towards it .
I'll buy it for that , where do I get it at ?
Round-trip would be preferable but one-way is fine if it's the best deal .
You're probably right , but that would mean I don't have a girlfriend .
It might be in the next town over but I can't guarantee that . You might want to call around .
Oh , I see it now . I didn't notice the can on the door .
Yes . I have an engine . The overheating is just what steam looks like .
I love my brother too , but that's only because he's a wonderful guy , and I love him .
Yeah , that's a good sign . If the music itself has no depth it's pretty boring :)
I'll have the red one . We'll call it " Mister Ford Fiesta . "
Oh , sorry . Thought you meant it was actually cheaper . I paid $ 15 for it .
You were fired ? How ? ! You should get a job at the new company ! / s
Oh I see . Well that's awesome that your girlfriend is coming to visit for the weekend with you . I hope you two have a good time . Good luck !
But not all fruits are vegetables .
I've trashed my party dress and the one from the last event .
You can take a tour if you want . The jades are really neat . There is also a small exhibition at the end of the week on the same building .
You can see what you're buying , and if it doesn't fit , you get free returns .
Sounds great . Will I be able to get to the hotel by the time I get home ? Or can you pick me up from the hotel ?
Then you'll be alright . It's a good day to fly , just make sure you have your suitcase and your luggage bag .
Sorry , I was just trying to make a funny comment . I am DuJuan .
You have that right , but it doesn't make you entitled to a relationship with the person you want to get married to .
We're already on the second , so we can just grab the first pitcher we come across .
That is good . How long is a journey for you ? If you don't mind me asking , how many days would it take you to reach there ?
You're not a true mam if you can't take a break when it's time for a real one . / s
Sure , why not ? What have you got to talk about ?
You might want to check out the TPF - TPE . It's a better deal than the Trans-Pacific .
I have a fever of thirty eight . I have no other symptoms besides the fever . What should I do ?
You'll need more than a question .
You can , but the appointments will be late .
That's a good call , and probably the smartest move . I can't even fathom why you would want to drive in the first place if you have a bus pass . I guess it's just not for everyone ?
From an unknown Chinese tea store called Toy Bonnie . (:
If you do come , I would suggest going up on top of the railing , or up the stairs . I don't think the climb is as difficult as it looks . It is a good hike in a good way .
The color of the violet is not girly .
I'm sorry , but I have to call the president
I don't even have an AM radio anymore . I just listen to the news and podcasts .
Nothing happened . It is just that this is not a good day .
I was watching a show . Nothing much , just sitting around and talking to you , Tina .
I think that's the most relevant name card I've ever seen
You have a good chance of getting on the aisle with me , I'm 6 ' 3 " .
Then he should at least tell her he's interested . That doesn't make him " scared " .
I don't know what's the best approach . I'm afraid that I can't find any other girl ...
Of course , my Lord . Doctor Johnson has been appointed .
It's more that computers are a great tool to help them learn , and a bad tool to teach them . There is a huge difference between the two .
I have some more luggage too . Let me know if you want some .
I'm not really up on all the stuff they have here , so I don't know how good their snowmaking is
I don't like milk but this is milk .
You can change your reservation , but you'll have to pay for the new date to be able to change it
I like Chinese food . But I also like western food and seafood .
Not the newspaper . The people at the resort are being evacuated by their families . No casualties at all .
Oh . If you can't watch tv , then just tell her you want her to turn it on for some music or something
Oh ! My bad ! I'll grab it from the kitchen and bring it back with . I don't have a salad , though ...
I just checked . The room is the same as it ever was .
He was having trouble getting a job . He was on vacation . I guess the interviewers didn't see eye to eye on a few questions and were trying to get the ball rolling early .
I'm sure you'll find it fulfilling , as I do , too .
Last week . It's the longest service guide I can write .
Well I know a thing or two about the economy , John . You have to decide .
Not only that but they're all professional trainers ( I think ? ) who have been in this business for so long it's hard to believe they all have such natural talent .
I am in college now . Major was English .
Yes you probably should . If they didn't find you on the job they aren't going to give you a job .
The washer . You put your change in the washer
Any of the ones that sells electronics , like ICQ / IRC . :)

Auto-reverse break is the worst . My Nexus 5 has it and every time I hit the button the phone breaks
That is a steal . I hope you have good luck finding a room with roommates .
Mr burton can hold for as long as he likes but he can ’ t make it until next Tuesday , we are meeting with a doctor who is a member of milford .
Well , the plan is to get a lot of data from your weight and then we'll use that information to design a workout .
The touchdown line is not there . The line is between the elbow and the thigh .
Nope , I think that's just what your body does to get used to the office .
Any time after 5 PM EST on Thursday . That's my time zone
Hot in winter , not too hot in summer . In the summer it gets to the 90s .
I'm not sure what that means , but sure . We could do with some of the stuff I have , but I can't really do much of anything right now .
It has no depth . But I enjoy it for the sake of it being pop . That is why it is my favorite genre
I chose my appointment at 7:30 pm . It was an open appointment
I'm going till the end of August . I've visited Sweden a few times
The magazine comes out in June . It's a great read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has read it or is considering reading it , even if they're pregnant .
I know , I know . It's the best time to hustle :)
So is the kid , but that doesn't mean you don't enjoy silly things . You're just immature .
The line moves faster when you're the only one there . The rest just move around .

Not that well but I've got the guitar and a few other instruments .
I am looking around for a replacement . Caffeine is a little more important at the moment and I'm just trying to find a good substitute . :)
I hate AC
I'm pretty sure you're the one who can't have a TV . The only TV that can afford to cost you that much is one that isn't made by a company that makes cheap TVs
The article I read was about the New World and I think they won because their name is on the list .
Smoking and non-smoking ?
