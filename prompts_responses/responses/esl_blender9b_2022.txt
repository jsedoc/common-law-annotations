Why do you say that? It's been raining here for the past couple of days.
I want to be buried, but I don't want my family to spend a lot of money on it.
I love imported chocolate. It's so much better than the stuff we have here in the US.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find what you're looking for. What are you looking for?
I am so happy for you!  I hope it is everything you dreamed it would be!
I know, right? I can't wait to see how it turns out. I hope they don't screw it up.
That's what I thought at first, but it doesn't smell like it and it's not red.
I have a Labrador Retriever. He's the sweetest dog I've ever had.
That's true, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep it that way.
I don't know what I want to do with my life. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.
That would be great, thank you so much! I've been trying to learn on my own but I just can't seem to get it.
Do you have an adblocker enabled? I had to disable mine to get it to work.
I am from the United States. I live in the southeastern part of the country.
I wish I could, but I have to go to work in a few hours. I'm going to be so tired.
It's okay. It was a long time ago, but it still stings a little bit.
I'm sure you'll do great!  What kind of job are you interviewing for?
I would like to go to the beach. I haven't been there in a long time.
Not yet, but I can't wait to try it on.  I've been looking forward to it all day.
I just need someone to talk to. I feel so alone right now. I don't know what to do.
I don't know, but I'm glad we haven't.  It would be a disaster.
I do too. It's nice to be able to see the stars and the milky way.
I've heard that, but I still want to try it.  I've never had one before.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make it more comfortable for you?
What do you need help with? I'd be happy to help in any way that I can.
Oh no! I hope it wasn't too bad. Were you able to get it stitched up?
About a year and a half ago. It was a very amicable divorce, though.
I used to smoke cigarettes when I was younger, but I quit a few years ago.
I love it when it rains.  It's so relaxing.  What kind of dog do you have?
You're welcome! I'm glad you had a good time. Did you have a good weekend?
I do too.  They are so talented.  Do you have a favorite song of theirs?
Oh no! I hope it's not too bad. Is there any way you can get out of the house?
It's cold and white and fluffy and beautiful.  I love it.  Where do you live?
Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that old. I just saw it for the first time today.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if there was something I was missing.
The one that takes you to the place you want to go.  What is your destination?
I know what you mean. It's a lot of money, but I think it will be worth it.
I did, but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
I listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite band is the Beatles. What about you?
You can have anything you want, but you have to eat it all in one sitting. What do you want?
I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to explode. I've never felt this way before.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way. It's not that I don't want to learn, it's just that I'm afraid of public speaking.
I don't know. I just don't want to be alone anymore. I feel like I've lost my best friend.
That's a lot of money.  Did you have to go to court to get it reduced?
I'm glad he was able to get the help he needed. I hope he's doing better now.
That's what I was thinking. I got a ticket for parking on the wrong side of the street.
That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure if it was just me or not.
I only applied to one school. I didn't want to apply to too many in case I got rejected.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been trying for a long time? What kind of job are you looking for?
I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that? Is there anything I can do to help?
I've been here for about a year and a half now. It's been a great experience so far.

I go to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
That's what I was thinking. I got a ticket for parking on the wrong side of the street.

Do you have any tips on how to do it? I don't want to mess it up.

Oh no! I hope you feel better soon! Drink lots of water and get some rest!
Do you have any pets?  I have a dog and a cat.  I love them.
That's cool. What kind of music do you like? I'm more of a classic rock kind of guy.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way. It's not that I don't want to learn, it's just that I'm afraid of public speaking.
I won it in a raffle at work.  I was so excited to get it.
I don't know.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens.
I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope things get better for you.  If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.
I don't know. I just don't like being out in the sun. It makes me feel sick.
I'm not sure, but I hope so.  I don't want anyone to get sick.
I hope so too, but I don't know if they will.  It's so sad.
I don't remember exactly, but it was more than I wanted to spend. I think it was around $200.

What kind of sandwich are you going to make? I love grilled cheese sandwiches.

You'll have to trust me on that one.  I've been doing this for a long time.
What kind of food do you like to eat? Maybe I can help you find some new recipes.
No, I don't watch much television.  I've seen commercials for it though.
Yes, I did. I had to call a locksmith to come and open it for me.
That's a good idea. Did it make the food taste better or was it just a precaution?
That's okay, I appreciate you taking the time to answer my question.  Have a great day!
I've been here for about a year and a half now. It's been a great experience so far.
School was hard for me too.  I had to work really hard to get good grades.

How do you hold a knife wrong?  It's a tool, not a toy.
I just don't like them. I don't know why, but they just make me feel uneasy.
I did, but I didn't go as hard as I wanted to. I'm going to try harder next time.
That's what he said, but I don't believe him. I think he just didn't want to get in trouble.
Oh no! I hope you were able to get it repaired or replaced for a reasonable price.
It is, but you'll get used to it.  Just try to make some friends and you'll be fine.
Yes, the apartment was in great shape when I moved in.  I have no idea what happened.

Oh, I see. Well, I don't know much about it, but I do know that it is a form of public transit.
Of course you can!  I love lemons.  Do you have a favorite kind?
I'm not sure. I think I'd like to be able to do both, but I don't know if that's possible.
That's what I was thinking, but I didn't know if there was more to it than that.
It's about an hour and a half away. I don't know if I'll be able to make it.

Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought it was only on Sundays.  Do you like it?
That's what I thought at first, but it's been a few weeks now and I haven't heard anything.
That's a good idea. I'll have to see if I can find one that I like.
I can understand that. It can be a lot of fun to explore on your own. Do you live in a big city?
That's nice of you. What kind of present do you have in mind? I'm sure he'll love it.
That's a good idea. I think it would be a good way to introduce her to surfing.
That sounds like a lot of fun.  What kind of bike is it?  Is it a road bike or a mountain bike?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried different strains? Some are more stimulating than others.
Yes, that would be very useful.  Do you know of any good online dictionaries?
I know, but I feel like I'm the unluckiest person in the world right now.
Wow, that's a long drive.  Where are you going?  Are you going with anyone?
That sounds like a lot of fun!  What are you going to do?  I love the Wizard of Oz!

No, they are over the counter. You can get them at Walgreens or CVS.
Yes it is.  It is nice to have a good relationship with your landlord.
I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Do you mean my computer's hard drive?
I hate when that happens. Did you end up getting to your destination on time at least?

That's a good attitude to have. I'm sure you'll be able to pay it off soon.

You can find them in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds.

I do have a job, I just don't make a lot of money. I'm trying to save up for a house.
I don't think so.  I think it was just a fluke.  It tasted fine.
No, I just don't want to go. I don't like being around a lot of people.

I'm not sure what you mean by what do I mean. Do you mean what are they?
Thank you! It's nice to be here. I've been lurking for a while.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to find a way to get where you need to go.

I don't think I've taken a bath since I was a kid. I shower every day though.
I know, but I don't think I'm cut out for it. I'm too shy and introverted.

Christmas is my favorite time of the year. Do you have any plans for the holiday season?

That's too bad. I hope you get to see each other soon. How long has it been?
Sure, I can sell you one.  How much are you looking to spend?  Do you have a Costco membership?
It was a tomato basil soup. It was so good and I was so sad when it was all gone.
That's true, but I think I can do it. I just need to find the right person.
Yes, I can write a letter of recommendation for you.  What do you need it for?
Do you have a heater you can turn on? Or do you just have to wait it out?

I hate whistles.  They are so annoying.  Did you find out what it was?
I love camping! I am going to the beach with my family. I hope you have fun!

That's always a good thing to have in your life.  What did they do for you?
That's what I was thinking, but I just wanted to make sure. Thanks for the reply!
Me too! I would love to live in a place like that. It would be so peaceful.

I hate when that happens. Did you at least get a chance to nap during the day?
I could go for a pizza right now.  What kind do you like?  I like pepperoni.
Yeah, I was a little worried about that. I guess I'll just have to keep an eye on it.
I hope you're right. I feel like I'm going to fail. I'm so nervous.

They do, but they also have to go to school for a long time to get to that point.
Are you going to tell me what you're going to do to me?  I don't like surprises.
I teach 7th grade science.  It's a lot of fun, but it can be challenging at times.

What kind of questions do you have? I might be able to answer some of them for you.
That's true, but I don't know them as well as I know her. She was my best friend.

Do you go to USC? It's one of the most prestigious universities in the US.

That's what I thought at first, but then I looked closer and saw that they were.
Oh no!  I hope it's nothing serious.  Are you a radiologist?
That's a good idea. I think I'll do that next time I go out to eat.
