depends on what you need and what you're going to need the hospital for , i guess :P
I don ’ t need the vegetables , just the fish .
I'm not online right now but I can help you later .
but if you go to a outlet you don't get to feel like you're buying a $ 300 jacket or $ 500 pants that are made of cashmere

Barcelona had a better defence and the midfield was not as good as Madrid's . I think it was more than fair

I'm a woman , I don't think I've ever had 10 cups in a minute , but I can do it with one hand . It's just so hard to drink all those cups .
So is there a difference between dial up and del ? Or just preference ?

Sorry ! For a while in my town , I had a bunch of amenities , but they'd disappear when I left the game . Do I need to build more or something ? What does it do ?
I'd argue that yelling actually does . It makes you more likely to be heard . The people who yell at me are generally not the ones I want hearing from . Yelling helps .

You can take one of my tickets , I just can't take a whole show .
I've been on a vacation for months already ...
What about my reservation ?

I'm sorry to hear that . Why did you get fired , though ?

Okay ! How do we go about doing that ? What kind of topic do you want to talk about ?
I'm going to be going up from Minneapolis to Taipei . Can I get a refund on my ticket ?
Throat and headache . I have a high pain tolerance so I ’ m good .
How about this one ? The last question , I mean .
You'll have to talk to the person that runs the appointment desk , that's what they're for
Why not ? There are tons of buses that only require your ID and not a bus pass . And they are dirt cheap .
A shop called " China Tea Tree " ( or maybe that's the wrong name ? )

No way I could fit a larger into taxi ... unless you're going the same direction I'm going :P
That's not snowmaking , that's an advanced snowstorm making machine ! That makes it snow in a different location . You're thinking of a firestorm machine !
I do not like milk , only milk . It's the best .

I was hoping that they'd all be able to move so quickly on stage .
I had a BS in Computer Science . I've worked as a program manager since , though .
I found out the job I wanted by browsing jobs sites . I'd definitely check those out .
If you use the dryer as a washer , it's only a few cents to put in a pocket and a dollar or 2 .
It is really hard to say , because I am not sure when we will have enough time to go to every store .
Deboah is a woman ?
No , but I've had a bunch break .
That's really cheap . I'm in the city and I think I pay more than that for a night out .

We'll have a custom workout plan that you can make based on your habits and goals and you can then use it to make changes for yourself
The rule was changed this year . The rule says you must be able to touch them in the air .
It's not that . You're too skinny . You look skinny because you don't eat enough
I would like to do this on the next Thursday as well .
Weather in general is nice . It can get chilly at times but we get used to it . But I live in the UK so weather isn't a huge factor as we usually don't go out .
I'm in the UK unfortunately , so no window shopping for me .
Pop music has lots of depth . Try it .
The time that my appointment ended .
The whole week ( I ’ m staying with a friend in Sweden ) . I don ’ t know where I will be staying yet .
It comes out every Friday ! It ’ s usually about a month after the newest issue comes out , but I have the entire magazine ! !
It's already 5 so you could hustle even earlier ! We can make our way up to the first base dugout . :D
I was talking about the OP . I have to admit , I have no idea why I called you a kid either .

I've been looking for a new one as well . Coffee is a good choice . What's it like on Mondays , Michael ?
My air conditioner is broken . I need an exterminator .
Well then get a job and don't get a TV . It's not like you'll get anything better for your money .
Well the seven wonders are named . They just have their own category in their website . The winner is the first to get voted off .
Well then , we have a non-smoking tables at Buffalo Wild Wings . :)
