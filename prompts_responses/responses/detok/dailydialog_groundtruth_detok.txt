You also need to control what starts up. There is a program calls Start-up Delayer, It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts. For example, you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up.
Just a moment. I will do it right now.
I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time?
Sure. First of all, it's very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don't think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.

Is there anything else that I can do for you today?
Mike! Good to hear from you. How are you?

May I see your library card, please?
A hike would be great! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch, OK?
I apologize, but the cable has been down lately.
Very good. How much does that cost?
It's really a surprise.

Why did you tell me to get off?
DEL is better than dial-up?
Five thirty? I have a dinner appointment at six.
My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week's check.
So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared?
We also will have to check your department budget. Do you know how much money you have for office supplies?
The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom.
Very well then. Are mornings or afternoons best?

Can you tell me what night you will be coming?

Any other ideas?
This is a first! You must have won the lottery.
Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks.

Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique. I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else.
How come? Last time I saw you. You told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. That was only one month ago. Why this sudden change?
Wait a minute, you mean you met her online?
And the chicken?
Why did you drag me into this? I've spent a week salary.
No problem.
That's right. Seeing is believing.
That's great. It's most thoughtful of you to do this, Miss Rose.

I love it. It's so festive! And where did you get that cup? It's got the same logo.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Wang. You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada.
Another place you can get real insight is European papers. You can get them on-line.
Two men pushed into the flat. One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me.
I just watched a movie and I'm scared.

Thank you.
Right now we have a suite for 4 people, do you want to book it?
Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn't have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different HMO's.
Yes, okay.

Oh, that's easy. If it's better than the one you are doing now, go for it. That's my advice.
And all their movements are so elegant. It seems like dancing in the water.
I majored in Public Relations.

The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.
I want to buy some clothes in clothing store. When we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken.

That price is perfectly acceptable.
No problem.
