I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Is the power on?
I'm from out of town.
I will.
It's just really frustrating. I worked so hard and I thought I had a good chance, but they said I wasn't qualified.
Well, first of all, try to relax. Second, make sure you know as much as possible about the company and the position you're interviewing for. Finally, plan out some questions you'd like to ask the interviewer.
I don't know. What do you want?
No, I'm going to wear it tomorrow.
I was wondering if you know of any openings.
We haven't gone very deep into the forest.
I see.
I know! I've been getting a lot of apples that are bruised.
Why don't you get a memory foam mattress?
Yes, I can help you.
Let me see.
About 5 years ago.
Is that a lot?
It's a good thing you came along when you did.
You're welcome. I had a great time too.
I do too.
Is anyone inside?
It's very cold and wet.
Why don't you just upgrade the software?
What law?

Yes, and it looks like the tooth on the bottom left is cracked.
I like to listen to the news and the weather.
You can order a variety of food items, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You can also order snacks and drinks.

Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Well, if he's into sports, maybe a ticket to a game or a gift certificate to a sporting goods store. If he's into cars, maybe a car detailing kit or a new set of tires.
That's a lot of money.
What did he say?
Yep, that's the price for parking in the red zone.
I think it's a moldy smell.
Just two.
Have you tried networking?
I don't think so either.
I've been living here for about 5 years.
What about the pilot?
I am not doing well in science.
What do you mean?
Yes, I am.
That's not really a good strategy.
I go to the University of Michigan.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Great! I'm glad you're coming.
Thank you!
It's okay, there's another bus that comes later.
Do you want me to come with you?
What is the meaning of life?
How many did you buy?
Same.
I was parking and someone hit my car.
You'll need to deposit more money into your account to cover the negative balance.
I'll try my best.
It's just so boring.
I don't know.
They believe in Jesus.
It was $500.
I don't care. I don't want to get my shoes sandy.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
I have some bread.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want me to get you anything?
We can look at reviews of the different services to see which one is the best.
Well, what do you want to eat?
No, I've never seen it on television.
I'm not sure. I can't seem to find my key anywhere.
What did your girlfriend's mom say?
An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
I've been living here for about 5 years.
You're telling me!
Why don't you just go online and buy one?
We told you that we weren't going to buy you a car.
The speed limit is for cars, not bikes.
What do you mean?
The food is great and the service is wonderful.
Yeah, I needed to get some exercise.

No problem.
I understand, but it'll be worth it in the end. You'll make new friends and get to learn new things.
It seems so, there weren't any complaints from the landlord.
You can register online or in person.
I hope it's not too late to get tickets.
I'll have to check them out. Thanks for letting me know.
So you would like it cut a little shorter this time?
Yes, I did. I also told her about my new friend.
Well, have you looked for it?
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Yeah, that would be great!
The public transportation here is great! There are buses and trains that go all over the city.
Sure, that sounds good.
Cigarettes.
I don't think that's true.
It's about 15 minutes away.
I'm looking for a white convertible.
I'll call you as soon as one is available.
What's the URL?
no reponse
Yes, there is a charge for guests to use the fitness center.
I'll have to check it out sometime.
That doesn't matter, you still owe me a dollar.
I've never seen it.
I hope so.
No, it's too close to the wall.
Okay, well there are a lot of things to see. The main square is really pretty, and there's a lot of history there. The cathedral is also a must-see. And if you're into museums, we have a few great ones.
Why don't you give him a gift card?
You might want to get him a more advanced board if he's been skating for a while.
That's great! I'm sure you'll do well.
It puts me to sleep, too.
I think you can find bilingual dictionaries at most bookstores.
I don't believe in that stuff.
I know.
Why are you going on a date with Mary at 6 p.m.?
And turn off the light.
No, you don't need a prescription.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What do you want to do with the database?
That's not a good excuse.
That's a good idea. I'll make sure to remember that.
I insist.
Yes, I am.
The bus stop is located on the corner of 4th and Elm.
Well, then I think you should buy her some pink roses.
What's wrong?
Well, there's some cheese and bread in the fridge.
Have you contacted your landlord about it?
Then what's the problem?
I know, I'm just not feeling inspired to do it.
I am just not in the mood to drive.
no reponse
How was it?
It's just not my thing.
I never received my package.
You probably have an ear infection.
Then your withdrawal will be from your checking account.
No problem.
What do you mean?
I'm getting rid of the trash from my party.
I use a lot of nails and a lot of patience.
You always were a little heavy set.
Yeah, I figure I need to start getting in shape now.
That's so great! Congratulations!
I am from Korea.
Yes, I did. I scored a 114.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's like the quality of service has gone down or something.
I don't remember getting a pamphlet.
What is it?
Yeah, the menu looks good, too.
You could add some stickers or a spoiler.
I'll help you up the stairs, but you'll need to use your crutches from now on.
You don't need it, but it helps me verify that you are a student.
Do you think that a woman president will be different than a man president?

Then you should register for the science class.
I understand, but we can't have any drinks until we are at a cruising altitude.
That's a good idea.
Have you tried using a fan?
Yes, it is definitely worth it in the end.
What are they?
That's not fair!
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Yeah, I know.
No, not really. I'll eat anything.
You must be tired.
It really depends on what you're looking for. There are some areas that are a bit run-down, but there are also some beautiful parts of the neighborhood.
That's a long way to go.
The one on the desk is out of ink.
What are you going to do?
No, it's not.
You should drink less coffee.
Do you have any specific styles in mind?
I'm not being sarcastic, I'm being funny.
Okay, the transfer has been completed.
We are not in a hurry.

You could always get a dog for that.
Then you should stop carrying pens in your pocket.
Yes, I pray every day.
I know.
Yes, there is a restaurant nearby.
I like to eat hot dogs.
My girlfriend.
I watered them this morning.
Thank you for letting me know.
Why do you like the weather to be warm?
You should look into universities in the suburbs.
No, why?
It could be.
I'm not sure.
That's not a good idea. You should always use different passwords for different websites.
What are some of your favorites?
It still looks too big for her.
Let me call an ambulance.
That's great!
Why?
That sounds like a lot of fun.
How much do you need?
It was!
That sounds like a lot of fun! I'll meet you there in a bit.
Well, it's not that difficult. You just have to unscrew the cap on the oil tank, pour the oil in, and screw the cap back on.
Because she is not interested in you.
I'm afraid of being swept away.
How much were you hoping to spend?
I don't feel like hugging anyone.

We have an hour.
I was introduced to the host by a mutual friend.
Sure.
Well, you could try walking to the next bus stop.
That's a lot of people.
I washed the clothes.
I don't want to.

That's good.

Why?
I was wondering if I could get a little more help with the material.
I'm sorry, I thought you meant a light trim.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Where are you moving?
Why don't you just buy a bus pass? It will save you money in the long run.
I have to be there at 11:45.
Because she's with someone else.
Why is gravity important?
For the use of our facilities.
The doctor said that I have a throat infection.

That's too bad.
Poison ivy is a super villain who can shoot poisonous ivy vines from her fingertips.

I think that's a better idea.
Oops. I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.
It is just a new experience and I am not sure what to expect.
Why is that a problem?
I love that each bedroom has its own bathroom!
Sure, I can help you.
What channel will the ads be airing on?
They talk about the things that are happening in their lives, just like people do.
I don't know.
Have you tried jiggling the key?
I don't really like camping.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that.
I agree.
I know that.
You're grounded.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Okay, I see that. We have you in a room with two queen beds.
I'm a great cook.
Be sure to use a disinfectant.
I'm glad we have the same opinion.
Do you have any specific styles in mind?
I don't want to get up.

I know, but I just don't feel like I fit in.
You could try an online database.
I was wondering if I could do an extra credit assignment.
Okay.
They have different kinds of bus passes. There is a regular bus pass, a student bus pass, and a senior citizen bus pass.

I'm not going that fast.
I'm not waiting for an order. I'm eating here.
Have you ridden a bike before?
Yeah, I'm sure she will.
Do you have any identification?
Yeah, they really do.
We have several different types of membership cards. What type are you interested in?

Did you use a knife?
I'm sorry for the delay, sir. I've been busy.
Yes, they are.
That's not so bad.
I think it's that one over there.
I loved you the first day I saw you, too.
I didn't know that. I'm not sure if I'm going to vote or not.
It's so exciting to be able to pick out new gear.
That sounds like a great idea!
We do blood tests here all the time, so I'm sure you'll be just fine.

What do you want to do with the money?
Thank you.

No, I didn't know that!
I think they're supposed to be bubbles.

Agreed.
It's a great app for staying connected with your friends and followers.
It's probably because the owner wants to make more money.
I'm sorry that happened. Let's get you fixed up.
What?
But I only parked for a minute!
Good.
Yes, it is in the lease.
And it's not too small.
What do you mean?
Why don't you talk to your advisor and see if there is a way to make the change.
We can use our hands.
I am.
That sounds like a lot of work.
I know. It's so gross.
I got one for my birthday.
No problem.

Cheese comes from cows.

Thank you.
Mine is from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

I don't have a bike.
I see. So, what do you have in mind?
I'm not mean, she was just bad.
Okay, John. Your credit balance is $2,375.

I am currently a senior at UCLA, majoring in economics. I have worked extensively with children throughout my years as a tutor and camp counselor, and I hope to continue working with kids in the future. I am also a huge sports fan, and I love playing and watching all sorts of sports.
I always pay my phone bills on time. I don't know why they would have cut my service.
I know, but the bad insects can do a lot of damage.
Do you want to go home?
Why?
I can't. It's too loud.
Well, it might be the power cord. Try another one.
Ten minutes.
That's why you should check your shoes.
You should take a break.

It's so good! I love it!
What do you want to do?
I don't care.
Gross.
I would have to say that my idea of a perfect date is spending time with someone I love, doing something we both enjoy.
Why do we need to buy a house?
Why didn't you sit in the front?
Great! When would you like to come by?
What is it?
There are about 8 hours left.
That's cool.
We are very blessed.
Twelve times? Why?
Is there anything I can do?
Have you talked to him about how you feel?
I don't want to get fat.
Yes, it's a devastating loss for the homeowners.

I know, right?
Why not?
How do you use the calling card?
What type of claim are you filing?
No, it's not a surfboard.
Sure, what do you need?

Yeah, I know.
Why are you hoping they will see your drawings?
The bus driver will tell you when to get off the bus.
It's a game on Facebook.

I'll be sure to leave a note for the package carrier.
It's considered bad manners to stick your chopsticks in the rice like that.

Yeah, I like it too.
What kind of cake?

She's not responding to me, and her face is really droopy.
I don't think so. I think they look fine.
Hmm, well I'm sorry you're tired.
No, I just sprained my ankle.
No, it's a strategy game.
The green one is for recycling and the black one is for regular trash.
That's a good reason.
Yeah, I'm really enjoying it.
So did I.
Yes, I read it. I think it's good.
Oh, sure.
I don't have enough room for more pets.
It's probably because of the construction.
Great! Bring it over here and we'll check it in for you.
Wow, that's a lot!
That's too bad. I'm sure you'll find something else to wear.
I'm sorry, but I don't know John's son's address either.
That's ridiculous! There's no way they can get away with that.

I'm trying to learn about all the different teams.
The big switch? What are you talking about?
Sounds good to me!
You're right. It was really good.
I try to avoid touching anything if I can.
Because he's my husband.
I've been reading books and watching TV.
That's so nice of him.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What makes you think that?
Yes.
Yeah, I heard a few accidents happened because of the wind.
I don't think it will do much good.
I love the windows.
Okay.

Thanks. I'm glad you liked it.
I know, it's so scary!

I don't know about that.

Tell me anyways.

Apparently.
It rained.
I was assigned to do a task that I had no experience with.
Oh, the one who was drunk.
I read that book in high school. It's a great book.
I started eating healthy and working out.

Unfortunately, no. Traffic school is not an option for mandated individuals.
Okay, then you'll need to find a school that offers a biology degree.
