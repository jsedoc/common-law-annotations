I'm sorry to hear that. I hope it's not too much of a hassle.
Yeah, it was pretty bad. 
No, I am not married. 
That's a lot of smoking 
That's what she said. 
No this is patrick. 
I'm not a big fan of the beatles. 
That's not very nice. 
No, but it does snow in the mountains. 
What's wrong with your current one? 
Don't tell me what to do. 
I'm not sure, but I'm sure you can look it up online.

Have you tried turning it off and on again? 
Why do you hate going outside? 
They're sweeping. 
How do you feel about that?

Why did she get mad? 
Because I like apples. 
It's going well, thanks for asking. How about you?

I hope so too, but I'm not holding my breath. 
Do you have a favorite one? 
No, I don't have a car. 
I think I'm going to have a salad. 
What do you mean by that? 
That's what I was thinking. 
I don't know, but I'm tired of it. 
I'm not really looking for anything in particular. I'm just looking for something that's fun to drive.
Sure, I'll let you know when the gate is open. 
Oh really? What is it called? 
College food is the best food. 
I don't think so. 
I don't know what that is. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
Who is your favorite judge on the show? Mine is Judge Mathis, he's hilarious.

Sounds good to me. Just let me know when you're ready. 
I don't get it.
