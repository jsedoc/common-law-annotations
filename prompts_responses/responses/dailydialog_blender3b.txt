Yes, I've been playing the piano since I was a little kid. I love it!
I don't drink coffee, but I do like tea.  Do you have any recommendations?
I love air conditioning. It's so nice to be able to turn it on when it's hot outside.
Yeah, it's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it for the quality.
It was a draw, but it was a very close game.  I was very happy with the result.
I'm sorry, but we do not have any non smoking tables.  Is there anything else you'd like?
